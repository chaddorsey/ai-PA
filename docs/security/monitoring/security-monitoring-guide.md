# Verify threat detection rules
grep -c "^RULE_" monitoring/security/threat-detection-rules.conf

# Check log sources
ls -la /var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog
```

**Solution**: Verify threat detection configuration and log sources

#### 2. Vulnerability Scanning Failures

**Problem**: Vulnerability scans are failing
```bash
# Check scanner configuration
cat monitoring/security/vulnerability-scanner.conf

# Test scanner manually
./monitoring/security/vulnerability-scanner.sh

ping -c 1 localhost
```

**Solution**: Verify scanner configuration and network connectivity

#### 3. Security Logging Issues

**Problem**: Security logs are not being generated
```bash
# Check log directory permissions
ls -la logs/security/

# Test log file creation
echo "test" > logs/security/test.log
