## Version Management Strategy

### 1. Version Lock Management

#### Pin All Dependencies
```yaml
# Always pin specific versions in versions.lock.yml
n8n:
  image: "docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n"
  tag: "1.109.2"  # Specific version, not "latest"
  version: "1.109.2"
  locked: true
```

#### Regular Version Audits
```bash
# Weekly version audit
./scripts/version-management/detect-versions.sh
./scripts/version-management/validate-versions.sh
```

#### Version Documentation
- Document all version changes with reasons
- Maintain version history and change logs
- Track security updates and patches

### 2. Upgrade Planning

#### Staged Rollout Strategy
1. **Development Environment**: Test upgrades first
2. **Staging Environment**: Validate with production-like data
3. **Production Environment**: Deploy during maintenance windows

#### Upgrade Windows
- **Planned Maintenance**: Schedule upgrades during low-usage periods
- **Emergency Updates**: Have emergency upgrade procedures ready
- **Communication**: Notify users of planned maintenance

#### Dependency Management
```bash
# Check dependencies before upgrades
./scripts/compatibility/validate-compatibility.sh --check-all
```

## Upgrade Best Practices

### 1. Pre-Upgrade Preparation

#### System Readiness
```bash
# Pre-upgrade validation
./scripts/upgrades/validation/pre-upgrade-check.sh

# System health check
./scripts/health-check-all.sh

# Backup creation
./scripts/backup/create-backup.sh --pre-upgrade
```

#### Compatibility Validation
- Check compatibility matrix for target versions
- Validate API compatibility
- Test database migrations
- Verify integration compatibility

#### Risk Assessment
- Evaluate upgrade complexity
- Identify potential breaking changes
- Plan rollback procedures
- Prepare emergency contacts

### 2. Upgrade Execution

#### Sequential Upgrades
```bash
# Upgrade frameworks in dependency order
./scripts/upgrades/coordination/upgrade-all.sh --frameworks "n8n,letta,graphiti" --sequential
```

#### Validation at Each Step
- Test service health after each upgrade
- Validate critical functionality
- Check integration status
- Monitor performance metrics

#### Documentation
- Record upgrade progress
- Document any issues encountered
- Update version lock files
- Maintain upgrade logs

### 3. Post-Upgrade Validation

#### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Post-upgrade validation
./scripts/upgrades/validation/post-upgrade-validation.sh

# Compatibility testing
./scripts/compatibility/run-all-compatibility-tests.sh --generate-report
```

#### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor system performance
- Check resource utilization
- Validate response times
- Monitor error rates

## Compatibility Management

### 1. Version Compatibility Matrix

#### Regular Updates
- Update compatibility matrix with each new version
- Test compatibility combinations
- Document known issues
- Provide upgrade recommendations

#### Compatibility Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive compatibility testing
./scripts/compatibility/run-all-compatibility-tests.sh --generate-report

# Framework-specific testing
./scripts/compatibility/validate-compatibility.sh --framework n8n --target-version 1.110.0
```

### 2. API Compatibility

#### Versioning Strategy
- Use semantic versioning (semver)
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes
- Provide migration guides

#### Testing Procedures
- Test all API endpoints
- Validate request/response formats
- Check authentication compatibility
- Test error handling

### 3. Database Compatibility

#### Schema Management
- Version database schemas
- Plan migration strategies
- Test data integrity
- Validate performance impact

#### Migration Testing
- Test migrations in staging
- Validate data integrity
- Check performance impact
- Plan rollback procedures

## Rollback Best Practices

### 1. Rollback Planning

#### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Create comprehensive backups
./scripts/backup/create-backup.sh --pre-upgrade

# Verify backup integrity
./scripts/rollback/validate-backup.sh --backup-path <path>
```

#### Rollback Procedures
- Document rollback procedures
- Test rollback procedures in staging
- Prepare rollback scripts
- Train team on rollback procedures

### 2. Emergency Rollback

#### Quick Response
```bash
# Emergency rollback
./scripts/rollback/emergency-rollback.sh --framework <framework> --target-version <version>
```

#### Decision Criteria
- Service health degradation
- Data integrity issues
- Performance problems
- Security vulnerabilities

### 3. Rollback Validation

#### Post-Rollback Testing
- Validate service functionality
- Check data integrity
- Test integrations
- Monitor performance

## Documentation and Communication

### 1. Documentation Standards

#### Comprehensive Coverage
- Document all procedures
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Provide examples and screenshots
