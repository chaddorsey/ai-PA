## Description

Configure Cloudflare tunnel routes to enable external access to all PA ecosystem services through secure HTTPS connections.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Configure Published application routes in Cloudflare dashboard
- Map external hostnames to internal Docker service URLs
- Ensure all services are accessible via HTTPS
- Verify tunnel routing is working correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements
- All services must be accessible externally
- HTTPS encryption for all external connections
- Proper error handling for service unavailability

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Published Application Routes**:
   - Configure hostname routing in Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard
   - Map external hostnames to internal Docker service URLs
   - Set up proper service mappings

2. **Service Route Configuration**:
   - `letta.cd-ai-pa.work` → `http://letta:8283`
   - `webui.cd-ai-pa.work` → `http://open-webui:8080`
   - `n8n.cd-ai-pa.work` → `http://n8n:5678`
   - `slackbot.cd-ai-pa.work` → `http://slackbot:8081`

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test external access to all services
   - Verify HTTPS connectivity
   - Confirm proper error handling

## Verification

### Test Results
- ✅ **Letta**: `https://letta.cd-ai-pa.work` - **Working** (200 OK)
- ✅ **Open WebUI**: `https://webui.cd-ai-pa.work` - **Working** (200 OK)  
- ✅ **n8n**: `https://n8n.cd-ai-pa.work` - **Working** (200 OK)
- ✅ **Slackbot**: `https://slackbot.cd-ai-pa.work/health` - **Working** (200 OK)

### External Access Commands
```bash
# Test all services
curl -I https://letta.cd-ai-pa.work
curl -I https://webui.cd-ai-pa.work
curl -I https://n8n.cd-ai-pa.work
curl -I https://slackbot.cd-ai-pa.work/health
```

## Files Modified

- `docs/delivery/6/6-3.md` - Task documentation created
- Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard - Published application routes configured

## Dependencies

- Task 6-1 (Cloudflare account and tunnel configuration) completed
- Task 6-2 (Docker Compose integration) completed
- All internal services running and healthy

## Notes

- Had to delete existing CNAME records as Cloudflare automatically creates them when configuring Published application routes
- Fixed Slackbot port configuration from 3000 to 8081
- All services now accessible externally with proper HTTPS encryption
- Tunnel logs show successful configuration updates and routing
