## Description

Test external access to all services and validate security implementation to ensure the Cloudflare tunnel integration is working correctly and securely.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Test external access to all services
- Verify HTTPS encryption
- Validate security headers
- Test service functionality
- Confirm tunnel routing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- All services accessible externally
- HTTPS encryption working
- Security headers present
- Performance within acceptable limits

## Implementation Plan

1. **External Access Testing**:
   - Test all service URLs externally
   - Verify HTTPS connectivity
   - Check service responses

2. **Security Validation**:
   - Verify TLS encryption
   - Check security headers
   - Validate WAF protection

3. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Test service-specific functionality
   - Verify data flow
   - Check error handling

## Verification

### External Access Test Results
- ✅ **Letta**: `https://letta.cd-ai-pa.work` - **Working** (200 OK)
- ✅ **Open WebUI**: `https://webui.cd-ai-pa.work` - **Working** (200 OK)
- ✅ **n8n**: `https://n8n.cd-ai-pa.work` - **Working** (200 OK)
- ✅ **Slackbot**: `https://slackbot.cd-ai-pa.work/health` - **Working** (200 OK)

### Security Validation Results
- ✅ **TLS 1.3 Encryption**: All connections encrypted
- ✅ **Security Headers**: Cloudflare adds security headers
- ✅ **WAF Protection**: Basic WAF active
- ✅ **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare DDoS protection active
- ✅ **SSL Certificates**: Automatic certificate management

### Test Commands
```bash
# External access tests
curl -I https://letta.cd-ai-pa.work
curl -I https://webui.cd-ai-pa.work
curl -I https://n8n.cd-ai-pa.work
curl -I https://slackbot.cd-ai-pa.work/health

# Security validation
curl -I https://letta.cd-ai-pa.work | grep -i "server\|cf-\|x-"
```

## Files Modified
