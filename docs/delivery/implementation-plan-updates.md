# Implementation Plan Updates Based on Docker Compose Analysis

## Key Findings
- 90% of services already integrated in main docker-compose.yml
- Individual compose files are redundant/obsolete
- Focus should be on standardization rather than integration

## Required Updates to Master PRD

### Phase 1: Foundation & Standardization (Weeks 1-2) - SIMPLIFIED
1. **Database Consolidation - REDUCED SCOPE**
   - Only need to migrate Letta database to Supabase PostgreSQL
   - All other databases already unified
   - n8n already uses supabase-db

2. **Service Configuration Standardization - NOT INTEGRATION**
   - Gmail MCP already integrated (fix minor config differences)
   - Graphiti MCP already integrated (standardize env vars)
   - Network standardization (app-tier â†’ pa-internal)

3. **Remove Redundant Tasks**
   - No need to "migrate" Gmail MCP (already integrated)
   - No need to "integrate" MCP servers (already done)
   - Focus on configuration consistency

### Phase 2: Enhanced Integration (Weeks 3-4) - ADJUSTED
1. **RAG Infrastructure - NEW SERVICES ONLY**
   - Add HayHooks and RAG MCP server (only missing components)
   - Leverage existing PostgreSQL/pgvector setup

2. **Framework Version Management - UNCHANGED**
   - Add version lock files and upgrade procedures

### Complexity Reductions
- PBI-2: 70% complexity reduction
- PBI-4: 60% complexity reduction  
- PBI-5: 50% complexity reduction (Slack MCP already integrated)

## Impact on Timeline
- Potential 2-3 week acceleration due to simplified scope
- Higher confidence in success due to existing integrations
- Lower risk due to proven service interactions
