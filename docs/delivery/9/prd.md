# PBI-9: Proper Secrets Management and Network Security Policies

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-9)

## Overview

This PBI establishes comprehensive security management and network security policies for the unified PA ecosystem, ensuring proper secrets management, network segmentation, and security best practices for home server deployment. The security framework will protect sensitive data, secure communications, and provide defense-in-depth security controls.

## Problem Statement

The unified PA ecosystem handles sensitive data including personal emails, Slack communications, AI conversations, and system credentials. Without proper security management, the system faces significant risks:

- Sensitive credentials may be exposed in code or configuration files
- Network communications may be vulnerable to interception or attack
- Lack of network segmentation may allow lateral movement if compromised
- No centralized secrets management creates operational complexity
- Missing security scanning and monitoring leaves vulnerabilities undetected

## User Stories

**Primary Actor: Security Engineer**
- As a security engineer, I want all secrets managed via environment variables so that credentials are never exposed in code or configuration files
- As a security engineer, I want network segmentation implemented so that services are isolated and lateral movement is prevented
- As a security engineer, I want TLS/SSL for external communications so that data in transit is encrypted
- As a security engineer, I want security scanning procedures documented so that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed proactively

**Secondary Actors:**
- **System Administrator**: Needs secure credential management and network isolation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Needs secure deployment procedures and environment management
- **Home Server Owner**: Needs confidence that the system is secure for home network deployment

## Technical Approach

### Security Architecture
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variable-based credential management with encryption
- **Network Segmentation**: Service isolation with controlled communication paths
- **Transport Security**: TLS/SSL encryption for all external communications
- **Access Control**: Role-based access and authentication mechanisms
- **Security Monitoring**: Logging, monitoring, and alerting for security events

### Security Components

#### 1. Secrets Management
- **Credential Storage**: Environment variables with encrypted storage
- **Secret Rotation**: Automated credential rotation procedures
- **Access Control**: Secure access to secrets with audit logging
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backup of sensitive configuration
- **Development Security**: Secure development environment practices

#### 2. Network Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated network segments for different service tiers
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive firewall policies with allow-list approach
- **Service Discovery**: Secure internal service discovery mechanisms
- **External Access**: Controlled external access with proper authentication
- **Network Monitoring**: Traffic analysis and anomaly detection

#### 3. Transport Security
- **TLS/SSL Implementation**: End-to-end encryption for external communications
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Secure Protocols**: Use of secure communication protocols only
- **Key Management**: Secure cryptographic key generation and storage
- **Protocol Validation**: Validation of secure protocol implementations

#### 4. Security Monitoring
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Threat Detection**: Automated threat detection and alerting
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security vulnerability assessments
- **Incident Response**: Documented security incident response procedures
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Security compliance validation and reporting

### Security Infrastructure
- **Vault Integration**: Secure secrets storage and management
- **Network Policies**: Docker network security policies
- **Certificate Authority**: Internal certificate authority for service certificates
- **Security Tools**: Vulnerability scanning and security monitoring tools
- **Audit Framework**: Security audit and compliance framework

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- **PBI 2**: Service unification must be complete for network security implementation
- **PBI 3**: Network unification must be complete for segmentation policies
- **PBI 6**: Cloudflare tunnel integration must be complete for external access security

### External Dependencies
- Security tools and vulnerability scanners
- Certificate authority services
- Security monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Encryption and key management tools

## Open Questions

1. **Secrets Management Tool**: Should we use Docker secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables for credential management?

2. **Certificate Authority**: Should we use Let's Encrypt, internal CA, or commercial certificate services?

3. **Network Segmentation Depth**: What level of network segmentation is appropriate for a home server environment?

4. **Security Monitoring Scope**: What security events should be monitored and how frequently should scans be performed?

5. **Incident Response**: What level of incident response capability is needed for a home server deployment?

6. **Compliance Requirements**: Are there specific security compliance standards that should be followed?
