## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- TLS/SSL encryption for all external communications and API endpoints
- Automated certificate provisioning, renewal, and management
- Secure communication protocols enforced across all services
- Cryptographic key management with secure generation and storage
- Protocol security validation and automated testing

### Technical Requirements
- TLS 1.3 implementation for all external-facing services
- Automated certificate management using Let's Encrypt or similar CA
- Secure protocol enforcement with protocol downgrade prevention

2. Configure automated certificate provisioning and management
3. Implement certificate storage and retrieval mechanisms
4. Set up certificate validation and chain verification
5. Create certificate management monitoring and alerting

### Phase 2: TLS/SSL Implementation
1. Implement TLS/SSL termination for all external-facing services
2. Configure secure protocol enforcement and cipher suites
3. Set up certificate-based authentication for service-to-service communication
4. Implement Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and secure key exchange
5. Create TLS/SSL configuration management and automation

### Phase 3: Certificate Management Automation
1. Implement automated certificate renewal and rotation procedures
2. Set up certificate expiration monitoring and alerts
3. Create certificate backup and disaster recovery procedures
4. Implement certificate validation and testing automation
5. Set up certificate transparency and monitoring

### Phase 4: Security Validation and Testing
1. Implement TLS/SSL security testing and validation procedures
2. Create certificate security assessment and penetration testing
3. Set up transport security monitoring and anomaly detection
4. Implement transport security incident response procedures
5. Create transport security documentation and training materials

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that transport security with TLS/SSL encryption is properly implemented and automated certificate management works correctly
- **Test Scope**: TLS/SSL implementation, certificate management, protocol security, and automation
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with TLS/SSL and certificate management deployed
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **TLS/SSL Implementation**: All external communications are properly encrypted
  2. **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate provisioning and renewal works correctly
  3. **Protocol Security**: Secure protocols are enforced and downgrade attacks are prevented
  4. **Key Management**: Cryptographic keys are properly generated, stored, and rotated
  5. **Security Validation**: Transport security controls prevent common attacks
- **Success Criteria**: All external communications are encrypted, certificate management is automated, protocol security is enforced, key management is secure
