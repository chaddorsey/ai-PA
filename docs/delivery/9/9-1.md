# [9-1] Implement Secrets Management Framework

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Establish a comprehensive secrets management framework using environment variables and encrypted storage to ensure no credentials are hardcoded in code or configuration files. This includes secure credential storage, automated rotation procedures, and secure backup mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- All secrets managed via environment variables with no hardcoded credentials
- Secure credential storage with encryption at rest
- Automated credential rotation procedures for critical services
- Secure backup and recovery procedures for sensitive configuration
- Development environment security practices with credential isolation

### Technical Requirements
- Environment variable management for all service credentials
- Encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data
- Automated credential rotation for database passwords, API keys, and certificates
- Secure credential injection into containers and services
- Audit logging for credential access and usage

### Security Requirements
- No credentials visible in logs or error messages
- Secure credential transmission between services
- Credential access control and authorization
- Secure credential backup and disaster recovery
- Development and production credential separation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Credential Inventory and Assessment
1. Audit all existing credentials and sensitive data in the system
2. Identify hardcoded credentials and security vulnerabilities
3. Categorize credentials by sensitivity and rotation requirements
4. Create credential management requirements and specifications
5. Design secure credential storage and access architecture

### Phase 2: Environment Variable Implementation
1. Convert all hardcoded credentials to environment variables
2. Create secure environment variable templates and documentation
3. Implement credential injection mechanisms for all services
4. Set up credential validation and verification procedures
5. Create credential management scripts and automation

### Phase 3: Encrypted Storage and Backup
1. Implement encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data
2. Create secure backup procedures for credential data
3. Set up credential recovery and disaster recovery procedures
4. Implement secure credential transmission mechanisms
5. Create credential access audit logging

### Phase 4: Automation and Rotation
1. Implement automated credential rotation for critical services
2. Set up credential expiration monitoring and alerts
3. Create credential rotation validation and testing procedures
4. Implement secure credential distribution mechanisms
5. Set up credential management monitoring and reporting

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that secrets management framework securely handles all credentials without hardcoded values
- **Test Scope**: Credential storage, access, rotation, and backup procedures
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with credential management framework deployed
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Credential Access**: All services can access credentials via environment variables
  2. **Security Validation**: No hardcoded credentials exist in code or configuration
  3. **Rotation Testing**: Automated credential rotation works correctly
  4. **Backup Recovery**: Credential backup and recovery procedures function properly
  5. **Audit Logging**: Credential access is properly logged and auditable
- **Success Criteria**: All credentials are managed securely, no hardcoded values exist, rotation and backup procedures work correctly
