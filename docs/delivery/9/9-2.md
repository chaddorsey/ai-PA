# [9-2] Configure Network Segmentation and Firewall Policies

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive network segmentation and firewall policies to isolate services and prevent lateral movement in case of compromise. This includes network isolation, restrictive firewall rules, and secure internal communication mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Network segmentation with isolated service tiers (frontend, backend, database, external)
- Restrictive firewall policies with allow-list approach (deny by default)
- Secure internal service discovery and communication mechanisms
- Controlled external access with proper authentication and authorization
- Network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities

### Technical Requirements
- Docker network segmentation with isolated networks for different service tiers
- Firewall rules restricting inter-service communication to required paths only
- Secure service discovery using DNS names instead of IP addresses
- Network access control lists (ACLs) for fine-grained traffic control
- Network monitoring and logging for security analysis

### Security Requirements
- No direct external access to internal services
- All inter-service communication authenticated and authorized
- Network traffic encrypted where possible
- Lateral movement prevention through network isolation
- Network segmentation validation and testing procedures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Network Architecture Design
1. Design network segmentation architecture with isolated tiers
2. Define network security zones and communication requirements
3. Create network topology diagrams and documentation
4. Specify firewall rules and access control requirements
5. Design secure service discovery mechanisms

### Phase 2: Docker Network Implementation
1. Implement isolated Docker networks for different service tiers
2. Configure network policies and access control lists
3. Set up secure service discovery using DNS names
4. Implement network isolation validation and testing
5. Create network configuration management and automation

### Phase 3: Firewall Policy Implementation
1. Implement restrictive firewall policies with allow-list approach
2. Configure inter-service communication rules and restrictions
3. Set up external access controls and authentication mechanisms
4. Implement network traffic monitoring and logging
5. Create firewall rule management and validation procedures

### Phase 4: Security Validation and Testing
1. Implement network security testing and validation procedures
2. Create network penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
3. Set up network monitoring and anomaly detection
4. Implement network security incident response procedures
5. Create network security documentation and training materials

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that network segmentation and firewall policies provide effective security isolation and prevent unauthorized access
- **Test Scope**: Network isolation, firewall rules, service discovery, and security controls
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with network segmentation and firewall policies implemented
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Network Isolation**: Services in different tiers cannot communicate unless explicitly allowed
  2. **Firewall Enforcement**: Firewall rules properly restrict and allow traffic as configured
  3. **Service Discovery**: Internal services can discover each other securely via DNS
  4. **External Access**: External access is properly controlled and authenticated
  5. **Security Validation**: Network security controls prevent common attack vectors
- **Success Criteria**: Network segmentation is effective, firewall rules are properly enforced, service discovery works securely, external access is controlled
