4. Set up log integrity and tamper-proof logging mechanisms
5. Create security log analysis and correlation capabilities

### Phase 2: Threat Detection and Alerting
1. Implement automated threat detection algorithms and rules
2. Set up real-time security event monitoring and analysis
3. Configure security alerting and notification mechanisms
4. Create threat intelligence integration and analysis
5. Implement security event correlation and incident detection

### Phase 3: Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment
1. Deploy automated vulnerability scanning tools and procedures
2. Set up regular vulnerability assessment schedules and automation
3. Implement vulnerability tracking and remediation workflows
4. Create vulnerability reporting and risk assessment procedures
5. Set up vulnerability monitoring and alerting systems

### Phase 4: Incident Response and Compliance
1. Implement security incident response monitoring and escalation
2. Set up security compliance monitoring and validation
3. Create security reporting and dashboard capabilities
4. Implement security audit and assessment procedures
5. Set up security training and awareness monitoring

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that security monitoring and logging infrastructure effectively detects threats, monitors security events, and provides comprehensive vulnerability assessment
- **Test Scope**: Security logging, threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and incident response
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with security monitoring infrastructure deployed
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Security Logging**: All security events are properly logged and accessible
  2. **Threat Detection**: Automated threat detection works correctly with appropriate alerts
  3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments identify and report issues
  4. **Incident Response**: Security incidents are detected and escalated appropriately
  5. **Compliance Monitoring**: Security compliance is monitored and reported accurately
- **Success Criteria**: Security monitoring is comprehensive, threat detection is effective, vulnerability scanning is regular and accurate, incident response is timely
