## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Network traffic monitoring for pa-internal network
- Service health monitoring with internal endpoints
- Network performance metrics collection
- Centralized logging for network events

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Monitoring must not impact network performance
- Logging must be comprehensive but not overwhelming
- Monitoring configuration must be maintainable

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Network Monitoring Configuration
Configure monitoring for unified network:
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor traffic patterns within pa-internal network
- **Service Discovery**: Track DNS resolution and service discovery events
- **Network Performance**: Monitor latency and throughput metrics
- **Security Events**: Log network security events and access patterns

### 2. Service Health Monitoring
Update health monitoring for internal network:
- **Health Check Aggregation**: Collect health check results from all services
- **Service Dependencies**: Monitor service dependency health
- **Network Connectivity**: Track inter-service connectivity status
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor service response times

### 3. Logging Configuration
Configure centralized logging:
- **Network Events**: Log network connection and disconnection events
- **Service Events**: Log service startup, shutdown, and health changes
- **Security Events**: Log network security events and access attempts
- **Performance Events**: Log network performance issues

### 4. Monitoring Integration
Integrate with existing monitoring systems:
- **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose health checks and logging
- **External Monitoring**: Integrate with any existing monitoring tools
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts for network and service issues
- **Dashboards**: Create dashboards for network visibility

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that monitoring and logging systems provide comprehensive visibility into the unified network.

### Test Scope
- Network traffic monitoring
- Service health monitoring
- Logging functionality
- Monitoring performance

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Network Monitoring**: Test network traffic monitoring functionality
2. **Health Monitoring**: Verify service health monitoring works correctly
3. **Logging**: Test that network events are properly logged
4. **Performance**: Verify monitoring doesn't impact network performance
5. **Integration**: Test integration with existing monitoring systems

### Success Criteria
- Network traffic is properly monitored
- Service health monitoring works correctly
- Network events are comprehensively logged
- Monitoring performance meets requirements
- Integration with existing systems works

## Implementation Results

### Monitoring and Logging Configuration

#### **‚úÖ Standardized Logging Configuration**

**Applied to Key Services:**
- **supabase-db**: Database service with logging and labeling
- **cloudflared**: Tunnel service with enhanced logging and security labeling

**Standard Logging Configuration:**
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"    # 10MB per log file
    max-file: "3"      # Keep 3 log files (30MB total)
```

#### **‚úÖ Service Labeling for Monitoring**

**Standard Labeling Schema:**
```yaml
labels:
  - "service=<service-name>"     # Service identification
  - "component=<component-type>" # Component classification
  - "network=pa-internal"        # Network identification
```

**Applied Labels:**

| Service | Component Type | Network | Special Labels |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| **supabase-db** | database | pa-internal | - |
| **cloudflared** | tunnel | pa-internal | external-access=true |

#### **‚úÖ Network Monitoring Configuration**

**Network-Level Monitoring:**
- **Network Labels**: Applied to pa-network for identification
- **Security Classification**: `security=internal-only` label
- **Project Identification**: `project=pa-ecosystem` label
- **Environment Labeling**: `environment=production` label

**Network Monitoring Features:**
```yaml
networks:
  pa-network:
    name: pa-internal
    labels:
      - "project=pa-ecosystem"
      - "environment=production"
      - "security=internal-only"
```

#### **‚úÖ Monitoring Standards Documentation**

**Standard Configuration Template:**
```yaml
# Standard logging configuration for all services:
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"

# Standard labeling for all services:
labels:
  - "service=<service-name>"
  - "component=<component-type>"
  - "network=pa-internal"
```
