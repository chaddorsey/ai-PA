# [3-2] Remove unnecessary external port exposures

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Remove external port mappings for services that should only communicate internally within the pa-internal network, improving security by eliminating unnecessary external exposure while preserving functionality.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Remove external port mappings for internal-only services
- Preserve external access for services that legitimately need it
- Ensure all inter-service communication continues to work via internal network
- Validate that removed services are still accessible via Cloudflare tunnel

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Changes must not break existing functionality
- Security improvement through reduced attack surface
- Maintain service discovery and health checks

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Service Analysis
Based on current docker-compose.yml analysis, identify services for port removal:
- **supabase-meta**: Currently exposes 8080:8080 - should be internal only
- **n8n**: Currently exposes 5678:5678 - should be internal only (accessed via Cloudflare)
- **neo4j**: Currently exposes 7474:7474 and 7687:7687 - should be internal only
- **graphiti-mcp**: Currently exposes 8800:8000 - should be internal only
- **letta**: Currently exposes 8283:8283 - should be internal only
- **open-webui**: Currently exposes 3000:8080 - should be internal only
- **slack-mcp-server**: Currently exposes 3001:3001 - should be internal only
- **gmail**: Currently exposes 7331:7331 - should be internal only

### 2. External Access Preservation
- **cloudflared**: Keep as primary external access point
- Verify Cloudflare tunnel configuration covers all necessary services
- Ensure external users can still access services via tunnel

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Remove `ports:` sections from internal-only services
- Ensure all services remain on pa-network
- Verify health checks use internal endpoints
- Update any documentation that references external ports

### 4. Validation
- Test that services are accessible via internal network
- Verify external access works through Cloudflare tunnel
- Confirm health checks continue to function
- Validate no functionality is lost

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that removing external port exposures improves security without breaking functionality.

### Test Scope
- Internal service-to-service communication
- External access via Cloudflare tunnel
- Health check functionality
- Service discovery and DNS resolution

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Internal Communication**: Verify all services can communicate with each other using DNS names
2. **External Access**: Test that external users can access services via Cloudflare tunnel
3. **Health Checks**: Ensure all health checks continue to pass
4. **Security**: Verify services are not accessible from external networks

### Success Criteria
- All services communicate internally via DNS names
- External access works exclusively through Cloudflare tunnel
- Health checks pass for all services
- No services are accessible from external networks without tunnel
- System functionality is preserved

## Implementation Results

### Changes Made

Successfully removed external port mappings from the following services:

#### 1. **supabase-meta**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "8080:8080"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://supabase-meta:8080`
- **External Access**: Available through Cloudflare tunnel if configured

#### 2. **supabase-studio**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "54323:3000"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://supabase-studio:3000`
- **External Access**: Available through Cloudflare tunnel if configured

#### 3. **n8n**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "5678:5678"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://n8n:5678`
- **External Access**: Available through Cloudflare tunnel (already configured)

#### 4. **neo4j**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "7474:7474"` and `- "7687:7687"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `bolt://neo4j:7687` and `http://neo4j:7474`
- **External Access**: Not needed for external access (internal graph database)

#### 5. **graphiti-mcp**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "8800:8000"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://graphiti-mcp:8000`
- **External Access**: Not needed for external access (MCP server for Letta)

#### 6. **letta**
- **Removed**: `ports: - 8283:8283`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://letta:8283`
- **External Access**: Available through Cloudflare tunnel if configured

#### 7. **open-webui**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "${OPEN_WEBUI_PORT:-3000}:8080"`
- **Added**: `networks: [pa-network]` (also fixed missing network connection)
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://open-webui:8080`
- **External Access**: Available through Cloudflare tunnel if configured

#### 8. **slack-mcp-server**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "3001:3001"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://slack-mcp-server:3001`
- **External Access**: Not needed for external access (MCP server for Letta)

#### 9. **gmail**
- **Removed**: `ports: - "7331:7331"`
- **Impact**: Service now accessible only via internal network at `http://gmail:7331`
- **External Access**: Not needed for external access (MCP server for Letta)

### Security Improvements

✅ **Reduced Attack Surface**: Removed 9 external port exposures
✅ **Network Isolation**: All services now communicate via internal network only
✅ **External Access Control**: External access now only via Cloudflare tunnel
✅ **DNS-Based Discovery**: All services use DNS names for communication

### Validation Status

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE**: This task focused on **configuration changes only**. Actual validation testing was not performed as part of this task implementation.

#### **What Was Done (Configuration Changes):**
- ✅ Removed external port mappings from 9 services
- ✅ Added open-webui to pa-network
- ✅ Verified Cloudflare tunnel configuration exists
- ✅ Documented expected external access patterns

#### **What Needs to Be Validated (Not Yet Done):**
1. **External Access Testing**: Verify Cloudflare tunnel provides access to services that need it
2. **Internal Communication Testing**: Confirm all services can communicate via DNS names
3. **Health Check Validation**: Ensure all health checks still work with internal endpoints
4. **Service Functionality Testing**: Verify all services function correctly after port removal

#### **Validation Requirements for Future Tasks:**
- **Task 3-4**: Will validate DNS-based service discovery
- **Task 3-7**: Will perform comprehensive network isolation and security testing
- **Task 3-9**: Will perform end-to-end testing of all functionality

#### **Expected External Access Pattern:**
**Services that should be accessible externally** (via Cloudflare tunnel):
- **n8n**: Workflow automation
- **letta**: AI agent  
- **open-webui**: Web interface
- **supabase-studio**: Database management

**Services that should NOT be accessible externally** (now properly secured):
- **neo4j**: Internal graph database
- **graphiti-mcp**: Internal MCP server
- **slack-mcp-server**: Internal MCP server
- **gmail**: Internal MCP server
- **supabase-meta**: Internal database metadata service
