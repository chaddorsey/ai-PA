# [11-1] Establish Version Lock Management System

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive version tracking and lock management system for all frameworks (n8n, Letta, Graphiti) and their dependencies. This includes version lock files, dependency resolution, version tracking, and automated compatibility validation.

2. Implement dependency version tracking and management
3. Set up version pinning and constraint mechanisms
4. Create version validation and verification procedures
5. Implement version change tracking and audit logging

### Phase 3: Dependency Management
1. Implement automated dependency resolution and conflict detection
2. Set up dependency update detection and notification
3. Create dependency compatibility validation and testing
4. Implement dependency rollback and recovery procedures
5. Set up dependency management automation and scripts

### Phase 4: Version Management Automation
1. Implement automated version management and updates
2. Set up version compatibility validation and testing
3. Create version management reporting and analytics
4. Implement version management monitoring and alerting
5. Set up version management backup and recovery procedures

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that version lock management system accurately tracks and manages all framework versions and dependencies
- **Test Scope**: Version tracking, dependency management, compatibility validation, and automation
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with version management system deployed
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Version Tracking**: All framework versions are accurately tracked and managed
  2. **Dependency Resolution**: Dependency conflicts are detected and resolved automatically
  3. **Compatibility Validation**: Version compatibility is validated and conflicts are prevented
  4. **Change Tracking**: Version changes are tracked and audited correctly
  5. **Automation**: Version management automation works correctly and reliably
- **Success Criteria**: All framework versions are tracked, dependencies are managed correctly, compatibility validation works, automation is reliable

## Files Modified

- `config/versions/versions.lock.yml` - Master version lock file with all framework versions
- `config/versions/detected-versions.yml` - Detected versions from running containers
- `scripts/version-management/detect-versions.sh` - Automated version detection script
- `scripts/version-management/validate-versions.sh` - Version validation and compliance script
- `docs/version-management/README.md` - Comprehensive version management documentation

## Implementation Results

### Version Lock Management System Created
- **Version Lock File**: Comprehensive tracking of all 15 services
- **Version Detection**: Automated detection of actual running versions
- **Version Validation**: Scripts to validate version compliance
- **Documentation**: Complete user guide and procedures

### Current Status
- **Locked Services**: 14/15 (93% compliance)
- **Critical Services**: All locked (n8n v1.109.2, Letta v0.11.7)
- **Infrastructure**: All database and infrastructure services locked
- **MCP Servers**: All MCP servers locked with proper versions

### Key Achievements
- Detected actual versions for n8n (1.109.2), Letta (0.11.7), and cloudflared (2025.8.1)
- Created automated version detection and validation workflows
- Established version management best practices and procedures
- Achieved 93% version lock compliance across all services

### Next Steps for Future Tasks
- Create upgrade procedures for each service category
- Establish compatibility matrix between services
- Monitor slack-mcp for specific version releases
- Implement automated upgrade workflows
