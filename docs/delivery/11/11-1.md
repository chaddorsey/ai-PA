# [11-1] Establish Version Lock Management System

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive version tracking and lock management system for all frameworks (n8n, Letta, Graphiti) and their dependencies. This includes version lock files, dependency resolution, version tracking, and automated compatibility validation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Version lock files maintain current working versions for all frameworks and dependencies
- Automated dependency resolution and conflict detection
- Version tracking and audit trails for all version changes
- Automated compatibility validation and conflict resolution
- Version pinning and management procedures for critical components

### Technical Requirements
- Comprehensive version lock files for all services and dependencies
- Automated dependency resolution with conflict detection
- Version change tracking and audit logging
- Compatibility validation automation and integration
- Version management scripts and automation tools

### Management Requirements
- Centralized version management across all components

- Version management reporting and analytics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Version Inventory and Analysis
1. Audit all current framework versions and dependencies
2. Identify version management requirements and constraints
3. Analyze dependency relationships and compatibility requirements
4. Create version management architecture and specifications
5. Design version lock file structure and management procedures

### Phase 2: Version Lock File Implementation
1. Create comprehensive version lock files for all frameworks
2. Implement dependency version tracking and management
3. Set up version pinning and constraint mechanisms
4. Create version validation and verification procedures
5. Implement version change tracking and audit logging

### Phase 3: Dependency Management
1. Implement automated dependency resolution and conflict detection
2. Set up dependency update detection and notification
3. Create dependency compatibility validation and testing
4. Implement dependency rollback and recovery procedures
5. Set up dependency management automation and scripts

### Phase 4: Version Management Automation
1. Implement automated version management and updates
2. Set up version compatibility validation and testing
3. Create version management reporting and analytics
4. Implement version management monitoring and alerting
5. Set up version management backup and recovery procedures

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that version lock management system accurately tracks and manages all framework versions and dependencies
- **Test Scope**: Version tracking, dependency management, compatibility validation, and automation
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with version management system deployed
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Version Tracking**: All framework versions are accurately tracked and managed
  2. **Dependency Resolution**: Dependency conflicts are detected and resolved automatically
  3. **Compatibility Validation**: Version compatibility is validated and conflicts are prevented
  4. **Change Tracking**: Version changes are tracked and audited correctly
  5. **Automation**: Version management automation works correctly and reliably
- **Success Criteria**: All framework versions are tracked, dependencies are managed correctly, compatibility validation works, automation is reliable
