## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that framework-specific upgrade procedures work correctly and safely upgrade all frameworks without breaking system functionality
- **Test Scope**: n8n, Letta, and Graphiti upgrade procedures, configuration migration, data migration, and service coordination
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with all frameworks deployed and upgrade procedures implemented
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **n8n Upgrade**: n8n upgrade procedures work correctly with configuration and data migration
  2. **Letta Upgrade**: Letta upgrade procedures work correctly with configuration and data migration
  3. **Graphiti Upgrade**: Graphiti upgrade procedures work correctly with configuration and data migration
  4. **Service Coordination**: Multi-framework upgrades are coordinated correctly
  5. **Validation**: Upgrade validation and testing procedures work correctly
- **Success Criteria**: All framework upgrade procedures work correctly, configuration and data migration is successful, service coordination is effective, upgrade validation is comprehensive
