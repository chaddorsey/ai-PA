# PBI-11: Framework Version Management with Controlled Upgrade Paths

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-11)

## Overview

This PBI establishes comprehensive framework version management with controlled upgrade paths for n8n, Letta, and Graphiti, ensuring safe updates while maintaining cutting-edge features and system reliability. The version management system will provide controlled upgrade procedures, compatibility validation, and rollback capabilities.

## Problem Statement

The PA ecosystem depends on multiple frameworks (n8n, Letta, Graphiti) that require regular updates to maintain security, performance, and access to new features. Without proper version management, the system faces significant risks:

- Framework updates may introduce breaking changes or compatibility issues
- No controlled upgrade procedures may lead to system instability or downtime
- Lack of version compatibility validation may cause integration failures
- Missing rollback procedures may result in extended recovery times
- No version tracking makes it difficult to maintain system consistency and support

## User Stories

**Primary Actor: System Administrator**
- As a system administrator, I want version lock files to maintain current working versions so that I can ensure system stability and consistency
- As a system administrator, I want upgrade procedures documented for each framework so that I can safely update components without breaking the system
- As a system administrator, I want version compatibility matrices so that I can understand upgrade dependencies and requirements
- As a system administrator, I want rollback procedures tested and documented so that I can quickly recover from failed upgrades

**Secondary Actors:**
- **DevOps Engineer**: Needs automated upgrade validation and testing procedures
- **Product Owner**: Needs confidence that upgrades won't break existing functionality
- **Support Engineer**: Needs version tracking and compatibility information for troubleshooting

## Technical Approach

### Version Management Architecture
- **Version Lock Files**: Comprehensive version tracking for all frameworks and dependencies
- **Upgrade Procedures**: Documented, tested upgrade paths for each framework
- **Compatibility Matrix**: Version compatibility tracking and validation
- **Rollback Procedures**: Tested rollback mechanisms for failed upgrades
- **Automated Testing**: Upgrade validation and compatibility testing automation

### Version Management Components

#### 1. Version Lock Management
- **Dependency Lock Files**: Comprehensive tracking of all framework versions
- **Version Pinning**: Specific version pinning for critical components
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automated dependency resolution and conflict detection
- **Version Tracking**: Change tracking and audit trails for version updates
- **Compatibility Validation**: Automated compatibility checking and validation

#### 2. Upgrade Procedures
- **Framework-Specific Procedures**: Tailored upgrade procedures for n8n, Letta, and Graphiti
- **Dependency Management**: Upgrade dependency resolution and management
- **Configuration Migration**: Automated configuration migration and validation
- **Data Migration**: Data format migration and compatibility handling
- **Service Coordination**: Coordinated service upgrades and restart procedures

#### 3. Compatibility Management
- **Version Compatibility Matrix**: Comprehensive compatibility tracking
- **API Compatibility**: API version compatibility validation and testing
- **Database Compatibility**: Database schema and data format compatibility
- **Integration Compatibility**: Cross-service integration compatibility validation
- **Performance Compatibility**: Performance impact assessment and validation

#### 4. Rollback Procedures
- **Automated Rollback**: Automated rollback mechanisms for failed upgrades
- **Data Rollback**: Data and configuration rollback procedures
- **Service Rollback**: Service-level rollback and recovery procedures
- **Validation Testing**: Rollback validation and testing procedures
- **Recovery Documentation**: Comprehensive rollback and recovery documentation

### Version Management Infrastructure
- **Version Control**: Git-based version tracking and management
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD integration for upgrade testing and validation
- **Monitoring**: Version monitoring and alerting systems
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive version management documentation
- **Training**: Version management training and best practices

## UX/UI Considerations

### Version Management Interface

## Open Questions

1. **Upgrade Frequency**: How frequently should framework upgrades be performed and what triggers upgrade decisions?

2. **Testing Scope**: What level of testing is required for each upgrade type (patch, minor, major)?

3. **Rollback Timeframes**: What are acceptable rollback timeframes for different types of failures?

4. **Compatibility Windows**: How long should compatibility be maintained between different framework versions?

5. **Automated vs Manual**: Which upgrades should be automated and which require manual intervention?

6. **Performance Impact**: What performance degradation is acceptable during upgrade procedures?
