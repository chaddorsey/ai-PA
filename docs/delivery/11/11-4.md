# [11-4] Implement Rollback Procedures and Recovery

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create comprehensive rollback mechanisms and recovery procedures for all frameworks (n8n, Letta, Graphiti) with automated rollback capabilities, data and configuration recovery, and validation testing. This ensures quick recovery from failed upgrades.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Automated rollback mechanisms for all frameworks and upgrade scenarios
- Data and configuration rollback procedures with validation
- Service rollback and recovery procedures with coordination
- Rollback validation and testing procedures
- Comprehensive rollback documentation and recovery procedures

### Technical Requirements
- Automated rollback scripts and procedures for each framework
- Data rollback and recovery mechanisms with validation
- Configuration rollback and recovery procedures
- Service rollback coordination and orchestration
- Rollback testing and validation automation

### Recovery Requirements
- Quick rollback execution with minimal downtime
- Data integrity validation during rollback procedures

- Service availability validation after rollback
- Rollback success validation and reporting

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Rollback Architecture Design
1. Design rollback architecture and recovery procedures
2. Define rollback requirements and success criteria
3. Create rollback testing and validation procedures
4. Design automated rollback mechanisms and triggers
5. Create rollback documentation and recovery procedures

### Phase 2: Framework-Specific Rollback Procedures
1. Implement n8n rollback procedures and recovery mechanisms
2. Implement Letta rollback procedures and recovery mechanisms
3. Implement Graphiti rollback procedures and recovery mechanisms
4. Create framework-specific rollback testing and validation
5. Document framework-specific rollback procedures and troubleshooting

### Phase 3: Data and Configuration Rollback
1. Implement data rollback and recovery procedures
2. Create configuration rollback and recovery mechanisms
3. Set up data integrity validation during rollback
4. Implement configuration consistency validation and recovery
5. Create data and configuration rollback testing and validation

### Phase 4: Service Coordination and Automation
1. Implement service rollback coordination and orchestration
2. Create automated rollback triggers and mechanisms
3. Set up rollback monitoring and validation
4. Implement rollback success validation and reporting
5. Create rollback automation and integration procedures

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing
1. Implement comprehensive rollback testing and validation
2. Create rollback scenario testing and validation
3. Set up rollback performance testing and validation
4. Implement rollback failure testing and recovery procedures
5. Create rollback validation documentation and procedures

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that rollback procedures and recovery mechanisms work correctly and can quickly recover from failed upgrades
- **Test Scope**: Framework rollback procedures, data rollback, configuration rollback, service coordination, and validation
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with rollback procedures implemented and tested
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Framework Rollback**: All framework rollback procedures work correctly
  2. **Data Rollback**: Data rollback and recovery procedures work correctly
  3. **Configuration Rollback**: Configuration rollback and recovery procedures work correctly
  4. **Service Coordination**: Service rollback coordination works correctly
  5. **Validation**: Rollback validation and testing procedures work correctly
- **Success Criteria**: All rollback procedures work correctly, data and configuration recovery is successful, service coordination is effective, rollback validation is comprehensive
