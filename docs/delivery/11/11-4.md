# [11-4] Implement Rollback Procedures and Recovery

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create comprehensive rollback mechanisms and recovery procedures for all frameworks (n8n, Letta, Graphiti) with automated rollback capabilities, data and configuration recovery, and validation testing. This ensures quick recovery from failed upgrades.
