## Backlog Notes

### Priority Rationale
The backlog is ordered to address foundational infrastructure changes first, followed by service integrations, and finally operational improvements. This sequence minimizes risk and ensures each phase builds upon stable foundations.

### Dependencies
- PBIs 1-2 are foundational and should be completed before other PBIs
- PBI 3 depends on completion of PBI 2 (network unification)
- PBI 4 depends on completion of PBIs 2-3 (network and MCP standardization)
- PBI 11 (version management) should be implemented early in Phase 2 for safety
- PBI 12 (upgrade infrastructure) depends on PBI 11 and builds upon unified infrastructure
- PBI 13 (RAG infrastructure) depends on PBIs 1-2 (database consolidation and networking)
- PBI 14 (RAG database integration) depends on PBI 13 and must be implemented together
- PBIs 5-6 can be worked on in parallel after core infrastructure (PBIs 1-4)
- PBIs 7-10 represent final validation and productionization phases

### Scope Boundaries
This backlog covers the unification and production-readiness of the existing PA ecosystem. It does not include:
- New AI agent capabilities beyond current functionality
- Additional MCP servers beyond those currently deployed  
- Advanced orchestration features (Kubernetes migration)
- Multi-node deployment capabilities
- Advanced RAG features (multi-modal search, real-time document updates, advanced analytics)
- Integration with external document management systems beyond basic ingestion

### Success Criteria
The backlog is considered complete when:
- All services operate within a single Docker Compose configuration
- System can be deployed with a single command on target home server
- All current PA functionality is preserved and validated
- RAG infrastructure is operational with document search capabilities
- Framework upgrade procedures are tested and documented
- Comprehensive backup, monitoring, and documentation are in place
- Performance meets or exceeds current system benchmarks
