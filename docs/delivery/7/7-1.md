# 7-1 System Requirements Analysis and Validation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Analyze the system requirements for deploying the PA ecosystem and create validation scripts that check for prerequisites before deployment begins. This task establishes the foundation for all other deployment tasks by ensuring we understand and can validate the target environment.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [x] **Hardware Requirements Analysis**: Document minimum and recommended hardware specifications
- [x] **Operating System Support**: Define supported OS versions (Ubuntu LTS, CentOS, etc.)
- [x] **Network Requirements**: Document network connectivity and firewall requirements
- [x] **Storage Requirements**: Calculate disk space requirements for all services and data
- [x] **Memory Requirements**: Define RAM requirements for optimal performance
- [x] **CPU Requirements**: Specify CPU requirements and core count recommendations

### Technical Requirements
- [x] **Dependency Analysis**: Identify all required software dependencies (Docker, Docker Compose, etc.)
- [x] **Port Requirements**: Document all required ports and their purposes
- [x] **File System Permissions**: Define required file system permissions and ownership
- [x] **Network Configuration**: Document required network settings and DNS requirements
- [x] **Security Prerequisites**: Define security requirements and hardening prerequisites

### Validation Requirements
- [x] **System Check Script**: Create script to validate hardware requirements
- [x] **Dependency Check Script**: Create script to validate software dependencies
- [x] **Network Check Script**: Create script to validate network connectivity
- [x] **Storage Check Script**: Create script to validate available storage space
- [x] **Permission Check Script**: Create script to validate file system permissions
- [x] **Comprehensive Validation**: Create master validation script that runs all checks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
1. **Analyze Current System**: Document current production system specifications
2. **Research Best Practices**: Review Docker and home server deployment best practices
3. **Calculate Resource Requirements**: Analyze resource usage of all services
4. **Define Support Matrix**: Create matrix of supported OS versions and configurations

### Phase 2: Validation Script Development
1. **Create Individual Check Scripts**: Develop specific validation scripts for each requirement
2. **Integrate Validation Logic**: Combine all checks into comprehensive validation script
3. **Error Handling**: Implement clear error messages and remediation guidance
4. **Testing**: Test validation scripts on various system configurations

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. **Requirements Documentation**: Document all requirements in clear, user-friendly format
2. **Validation Guide**: Create guide for interpreting validation results
3. **Troubleshooting**: Document common validation failures and solutions

## Test Plan

### Test Objectives
Verify that system requirements analysis is accurate and validation scripts work correctly on various environments.

### Test Scope
- Hardware requirement validation
- Software dependency checking
- Network connectivity validation
- Storage space validation
- Permission validation
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Environment & Setup
- Clean Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system
- Clean Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system
- Clean CentOS 8 system
- Systems with insufficient resources (negative testing)

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Valid System**: All requirements met - validation should pass
2. **Insufficient RAM**: System with less than minimum RAM - validation should fail with clear message
3. **Missing Docker**: System without Docker - validation should fail with installation guidance
4. **Insufficient Storage**: System with insufficient disk space - validation should fail with space calculation
5. **Network Issues**: System without internet connectivity - validation should fail with network guidance
6. **Permission Issues**: System with insufficient permissions - validation should fail with permission guidance

### Success Criteria
- Validation script correctly identifies all requirement violations
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Script provides specific remediation steps
- Validation completes in under 30 seconds
- No false positives or false negatives in testing

## Verification

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All system requirements documented with clear specifications
- [ ] Validation scripts created and tested on multiple OS versions
- [ ] Requirements document includes minimum and recommended specifications
- [ ] Validation script provides clear error messages and remediation steps
- [ ] All validation checks complete successfully on compliant systems
- [ ] All validation checks fail appropriately on non-compliant systems

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Requirements analysis reviewed and approved
- [ ] Validation scripts tested on at least 3 different OS versions
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Error handling tested for all failure scenarios

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `deployment/requirements.md` - System requirements documentation
- `deployment/scripts/validate-requirements.sh` - Master validation script
- `deployment/scripts/validate-hardware.sh` - Hardware validation
- `deployment/scripts/validate-dependencies.sh` - Software dependency validation

### Modified Files
- None

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of current PA ecosystem architecture
- Access to production system for requirements analysis
- Test environments for validation script testing

### Blocking Dependencies
- None (this is a foundational task)

### Enables
- All subsequent deployment tasks (7-2 through 7-11)
