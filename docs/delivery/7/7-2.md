# 7-2 Master Deployment Script Development

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the main deployment script (`deploy.sh`) that orchestrates the entire PA ecosystem deployment process. This script will be the single entry point for users and will include an interactive setup wizard, automated dependency installation, and comprehensive error handling with rollback capability.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [x] **Single Entry Point**: One script (`deploy.sh`) that handles entire deployment process
- [x] **Interactive Setup Wizard**: Guided configuration process with user-friendly prompts
- [x] **Dependency Management**: Automated installation of Docker, Docker Compose, and other prerequisites
- [x] **Configuration Validation**: Real-time validation of user inputs and system state
- [x] **Progress Indicators**: Clear progress reporting throughout deployment process
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with clear messages and recovery guidance
- [x] **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert changes if deployment fails
- [x] **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and audit purposes

### Technical Requirements
- [x] **Bash Script**: Implemented as bash script for maximum compatibility
- [x] **Idempotent**: Script can be run multiple times safely
- [x] **Non-interactive Mode**: Support for automated deployment with configuration files
- [x] **Dry Run Mode**: Ability to preview deployment without making changes
- [x] **Configuration Backup**: Automatic backup of existing configurations before changes
- [x] **Service Validation**: Health checks to verify all services started correctly
- [x] **Network Configuration**: Automatic Docker network setup and service discovery

### User Experience Requirements
- [x] **Clear Prompts**: User-friendly prompts with helpful descriptions
- [x] **Default Values**: Sensible defaults for all configuration options
- [x] **Input Validation**: Real-time validation of user inputs
- [x] **Help System**: Built-in help and documentation references
- [x] **Progress Feedback**: Clear indication of deployment progress and estimated time
- [x] **Success Confirmation**: Clear confirmation when deployment completes successfully

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Script Architecture
1. **Script Structure**: Design modular script architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Configuration Management**: Implement configuration file handling and environment variable management
3. **Logging Framework**: Implement comprehensive logging system
4. **Error Handling**: Create robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Phase 2: Interactive Wizard
1. **User Interface**: Create user-friendly interactive prompts
2. **Configuration Collection**: Implement guided configuration process
3. **Validation Logic**: Add real-time input validation
4. **Help System**: Integrate help and documentation references

### Phase 3: Deployment Logic
1. **Dependency Installation**: Implement automated dependency installation
2. **Service Deployment**: Integrate Docker Compose deployment
3. **Health Checks**: Implement service health validation
4. **Rollback Mechanism**: Create rollback and recovery procedures

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual script components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test complete deployment flow
3. **Error Scenario Testing**: Test error handling and recovery
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate user experience

## Test Plan

### Test Objectives
Verify that the deployment script successfully orchestrates the entire deployment process and handles all error scenarios gracefully.

### Test Scope
- Interactive setup wizard functionality
- Dependency installation and validation
- Configuration file generation
- Docker Compose deployment
- Service health checking
- Error handling and recovery
- Rollback functionality

### Environment & Setup
- Clean Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system
- Clean Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system
- System with existing Docker installation
- System with insufficient resources (negative testing)

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Fresh Installation**: Complete deployment on clean system
2. **Existing Docker**: Deployment on system with existing Docker installation
3. **Insufficient Resources**: Deployment on system that fails requirements validation
4. **Network Issues**: Deployment with network connectivity problems
5. **Permission Issues**: Deployment with insufficient file system permissions
6. **Partial Failure**: Deployment that fails partway through (rollback testing)
7. **Re-deployment**: Running script multiple times on same system (idempotency)
8. **Non-interactive Mode**: Automated deployment with configuration files

### Success Criteria
- Script completes deployment in under 30 minutes on compliant system
- All services start successfully and pass health checks
- Error handling provides clear guidance for resolution
- Rollback successfully reverts all changes
- Script can be run multiple times without issues
- Logs provide sufficient detail for troubleshooting

## Verification

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single `deploy.sh` script handles entire deployment process
- [ ] Interactive wizard guides users through configuration
- [ ] All dependencies installed automatically
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents common errors
- [ ] Progress indicators show deployment status
- [ ] Error handling provides clear recovery guidance
- [ ] Rollback mechanism successfully reverts changes
- [ ] Comprehensive logging captures all deployment activities
- [ ] Script completes deployment in under 30 minutes
- [ ] All services pass health checks after deployment

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Script tested on multiple OS versions
- [ ] Error handling tested for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Rollback functionality validated
- [ ] User experience validated by non-technical testers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `deployment/deploy.sh` - Main deployment script
- `deployment/scripts/rollback.sh` - Rollback and recovery script
- `deployment/scripts/health-check.sh` - Service health checking script
- `deployment/logs/` - Directory for deployment logs
- `deployment/config/` - Directory for deployment configuration

### Modified Files
- None (this creates the foundation deployment infrastructure)

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Task 7-1 (System Requirements Analysis and Validation) - Required for validation logic
- Understanding of current Docker Compose configuration
- Access to production system for testing

### Blocking Dependencies
- 7-1: System Requirements Analysis and Validation

### Enables
- All subsequent deployment tasks (7-3 through 7-11)
- User deployment capability

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Script Complexity**: Mitigated by modular design and comprehensive testing
- **Platform Differences**: Mitigated by testing on multiple OS versions
- **Dependency Issues**: Mitigated by robust dependency management and validation

### User Experience Risks
- **Configuration Errors**: Mitigated by real-time validation and clear error messages
- **Deployment Failures**: Mitigated by comprehensive error handling and rollback capability
- **Long Deployment Times**: Mitigated by progress indicators and time estimates
