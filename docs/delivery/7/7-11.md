3. **Error Scenario Testing**: Test troubleshooting guides with common issues
4. **Feedback Collection**: Collect and analyze user feedback

### Phase 4: Validation and Reporting
1. **CoS Validation**: Verify all Conditions of Satisfaction are met
2. **Quality Metrics**: Measure and report on quality metrics
3. **Issue Documentation**: Document any issues found and their resolutions
4. **Final Validation**: Confirm PBI 7 is ready for completion

## Test Plan

### Test Objectives
Comprehensively validate that PBI 7 meets all Conditions of Satisfaction and provides the required functionality for home server deployment.

### Test Scope
- Complete deployment kit functionality
- Documentation quality and accuracy
- User experience and accessibility
- Performance and reliability
- Error handling and recovery
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Environment & Setup
- Clean Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system (primary test environment)
- Clean Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system (secondary test environment)
- Clean CentOS 8 system (compatibility testing)
- Systems with different hardware configurations
- Non-technical users for user acceptance testing

### Key Test Scenarios

#### 1. Complete Deployment Testing
- **Scenario**: Fresh system deployment using deploy.sh script
- **Success Criteria**: Deployment completes in under 30 minutes with all services operational
- **Validation**: All services pass health checks and are accessible

#### 2. Configuration Template Testing
- **Scenario**: Test all environment configuration templates
- **Success Criteria**: All templates generate valid configurations for their intended use cases
- **Validation**: Generated configurations work correctly with deployment script

#### 3. Documentation Quality Testing
- **Scenario**: Non-technical users follow documentation from start to finish
- **Success Criteria**: 90% of users successfully complete deployment using documentation alone
- **Validation**: Users can resolve common issues using troubleshooting guides

#### 4. Backup and Restore Testing
- **Scenario**: Test complete backup and restore procedures
- **Success Criteria**: All data and configurations can be backed up and restored without loss
- **Validation**: Restored system functions identically to original system

#### 5. Error Handling Testing
- **Scenario**: Test deployment with various error conditions
- **Success Criteria**: Error handling provides clear guidance and recovery options
- **Validation**: Users can resolve issues using provided troubleshooting guidance

#### 6. Performance Testing
- **Scenario**: Measure deployment time and resource usage
- **Success Criteria**: Deployment completes within performance targets
- **Validation**: System performance meets or exceeds benchmarks

### Success Criteria
- All PBI 7 Conditions of Satisfaction are met
- 90% of non-technical users successfully complete deployment
- Average deployment time under 30 minutes
- All documentation is accurate and accessible
- Error handling provides clear recovery guidance
- Backup and restore procedures work reliably
