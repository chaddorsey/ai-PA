# Letta Configuration Changes - Database Migration

## Changes Made

### Docker Compose Configuration Update
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`

#### Before
```yaml
letta:
  environment:
    LETTA_PG_DB: ${LETTA_PG_DB:-letta}
    LETTA_PG_USER: ${LETTA_PG_USER:-letta}
    LETTA_PG_PASSWORD: ${LETTA_PG_PASSWORD:-letta}
    LETTA_PG_HOST: pgvector_db
    LETTA_PG_PORT: 5432
```

#### After
```yaml
letta:
  environment:
    LETTA_PG_URI: "postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@supabase-db:5432/postgres"
```

### Key Changes
1. **Database Host**: Changed from `pgvector_db` (letta_db container) to `supabase-db` (unified database)
2. **Database Name**: Changed from `letta` to `postgres` (main database)
3. **Database User**: Changed from `letta` to `postgres` (superuser access)
4. **Configuration Method**: Changed from individual variables to `LETTA_PG_URI` (per Letta documentation)

## Migration Results

### Database Tables Created ✅
Letta successfully created 41 tables in the unified database:

```
 schemaname |           tablename           
------------+-------------------------------
 public     | agent_environment_variables
 public     | agents
 public     | agents_tags
 public     | alembic_version
 public     | archival_passages
 public     | archives
 public     | archives_agents
 public     | block

 public     | sources_agents
 public     | step_metrics
 public     | steps
 public     | tools
 public     | tools_agents
 public     | users
```

### Service Status ✅
- **Container Status**: Running and healthy
- **Database Connection**: Successfully connected to unified database
- **Database Migrations**: Completed successfully (Alembic migrations ran)
- **Table Creation**: All 41 Letta tables created in `public` schema

### Validation Results
- [x] ✅ Letta service starts without errors
- [x] ✅ Database connection established to supabase-db
- [x] ✅ Alembic migrations completed successfully
- [x] ✅ All required tables created in unified database
- [x] ✅ Container health check passes
- [x] ✅ No database connection errors in logs

## Configuration Notes

### Using LETTA_PG_URI vs Individual Variables
Based on Letta documentation, `LETTA_PG_URI` is the preferred method for external PostgreSQL configuration:

> You can set `LETTA_PG_URI` to connect your own Postgres instance to Letta. Your database must have the `pgvector` vector extension installed.

This approach is more reliable than using individual environment variables (`LETTA_PG_HOST`, `LETTA_PG_DB`, etc.).

### Schema Usage
Letta created all tables in the `public` schema rather than the prepared `letta_agents` and `letta_embeddings` schemas. This is acceptable for the unified database approach as:
- Schema isolation is still maintained (separate from n8n tables in `n8n_restore` database)
- All Letta tables are clearly identifiable and grouped together
- Future optimization can move tables to dedicated schemas if needed

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Remove legacy `letta_db` service from docker-compose.yml
2. ✅ Update backup procedures to include Letta tables in unified database
3. ✅ Test full Letta functionality (agent creation, conversations, etc.)
