# [4-1] Analyze current MCP server implementations and create standardized configuration patterns

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Analyze the current MCP server implementations (Gmail, Graphiti, Slack) to understand their configuration patterns, identify inconsistencies, and design a standardized configuration approach that can be applied across all MCP servers in the unified Docker Compose setup.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
1. **Gmail MCP Analysis**
   - Review docker-compose.yml Gmail MCP configuration (lines 358-377)
   - Examine gmail-mcp/ directory structure and Dockerfile
   - Document environment variables, volumes, and network configuration
   - Identify health check implementation

2. **Graphiti MCP Analysis**
   - Review docker-compose.yml Graphiti MCP configuration (lines 191-221)
   - Examine graphiti/mcp_server/ directory structure
   - Document environment variables, dependencies, and network configuration
   - Analyze health check and startup patterns

3. **Slack MCP Analysis**
   - Review docker-compose.yml Slack MCP configuration (lines 339-356)
   - Document environment variables and configuration patterns
   - Analyze health check implementation

### Phase 2: Pattern Design
1. **Environment Variable Standardization**
   - Define common environment variables across all MCP servers
   - Design server-specific environment variable patterns
   - Create environment variable naming conventions

2. **Health Check Standardization**
   - Design consistent health check endpoints and patterns
   - Define health check timing and retry configurations
   - Create health check response format standards

3. **Network and Volume Standardization**
   - Design consistent network configuration patterns
   - Define volume mounting patterns for MCP servers
   - Create service dependency patterns

4. **Logging and Monitoring Standardization**
   - Design consistent logging configuration
   - Define monitoring and metrics collection patterns
   - Create service labeling standards

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. **Configuration Pattern Documentation**
   - Document standardized environment variable patterns
   - Create configuration template examples
   - Document health check implementation guidelines

2. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Create guidelines for applying patterns to existing MCP servers
   - Document patterns for new MCP server development
   - Create validation checklist for MCP server configurations

## Verification

### Test Plan
- [x] Verify all current MCP server configurations are documented
- [x] Validate that standardized patterns cover all identified inconsistencies
- [x] Confirm patterns are backward compatible with existing functionality
- [x] Test that patterns support both HTTP and stdio MCP transports
- [x] Validate that patterns are extensible for future MCP servers

### Success Criteria
- [x] Complete documentation of current MCP server configurations
- [x] Identified all configuration inconsistencies
- [x] Designed comprehensive standardized configuration patterns
- [x] Created implementation guidelines and templates
- [x] Patterns are ready for application to existing MCP servers
