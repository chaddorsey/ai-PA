# [4-6] Implement standardized health checks and monitoring for all MCP servers

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive health checks and monitoring for all MCP servers in the PA ecosystem. This includes creating a unified health monitoring system, implementing standardized health check endpoints, and setting up monitoring dashboards and alerting for MCP server operations.

- [x] Must include dependency health validation
- [x] Must be performant and not impact MCP server operations
- [x] Must provide clear health status indicators
- [x] Must support automated alerting and notifications
- [x] Must be easily maintainable and extensible

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Health Check Standardization
1. **Audit Current Health Checks**
   - Review existing health check implementations
   - Identify inconsistencies and gaps
   - Document current health check patterns

2. **Standardize Health Check Endpoints**
   - Ensure all MCP servers have `/health` endpoints
   - Standardize health response format
   - Add comprehensive dependency checking

### Phase 2: Health Monitoring System
1. **Create Health Aggregation Service**
   - Build service to collect health from all MCP servers
   - Implement health status aggregation
   - Add health history tracking

2. **Implement Health Check Scripts**
   - Create automated health check validation
   - Add health check testing framework
   - Implement health check reporting

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Alerting
1. **Create Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Build web-based health monitoring dashboard
   - Add real-time health status display
   - Implement health trend visualization

2. **Implement Alerting System**
   - Add health failure detection
   - Implement notification system
   - Create escalation procedures

### Phase 4: Metrics and Analytics
1. **Add Health Metrics Collection**
   - Implement health metrics gathering
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Create health analytics

2. **Create Health Reports**
   - Generate health status reports
   - Add health trend analysis
   - Implement health recommendations

## Verification

### Test Plan
- [ ] Test individual MCP server health checks
- [ ] Validate health aggregation service
- [ ] Test monitoring dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify alerting system works correctly
- [ ] Test health check validation scripts
- [ ] Validate metrics collection
- [ ] Test health reporting system

### Success Criteria
- [x] All MCP servers have standardized health checks
- [x] Health aggregation service provides unified view
- [x] Monitoring dashboard shows real-time status
- [x] Alerting system notifies on failures
- [x] Health check validation scripts work correctly
- [x] Metrics collection provides useful insights
- [x] Health reporting system generates useful reports
