# PBI-12: Lean Upgrade Infrastructure with Automated Testing

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-12)

## Overview

This PBI establishes lean upgrade infrastructure with automated testing to validate framework upgrades in staging before production deployment with quick rollback capability. The infrastructure will provide automated workflow validation, database migration testing, and rapid rollback capabilities within 5 minutes.

## Problem Statement

Framework upgrades require careful validation to ensure system stability and functionality. Without proper upgrade infrastructure, the system faces significant risks:

- Framework upgrades may be deployed without proper testing, leading to production failures
- No staging environment for upgrade validation may result in untested deployments
- Lack of automated workflow validation may miss critical functionality issues
- No database migration testing may cause data corruption or loss
- Missing rollback capability may result in extended downtime during upgrade failures

## User Stories

**Primary Actor: DevOps Engineer**
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a staging environment for testing upgrades so that I can validate changes before production deployment
- As a DevOps engineer, I want automated workflow validation so that I can ensure critical workflows function correctly after upgrades
- As a DevOps engineer, I want database migration testing so that I can validate data integrity during upgrades
- As a DevOps engineer, I want rollback capability within 5 minutes so that I can quickly recover from failed upgrades

**Secondary Actors:**
- **System Administrator**: Needs confidence that upgrades won't break production systems
- **Product Owner**: Needs assurance that user-facing features work after upgrades
- **Support Engineer**: Needs quick rollback capability to minimize user impact

## Technical Approach

### Upgrade Infrastructure Architecture

## Open Questions

1. **Staging Environment Size**: What size and configuration should the staging environment have relative to production?

2. **Data Synchronization**: How frequently should production data be synchronized to staging?

3. **Testing Scope**: What level of testing is required for different types of upgrades (patch, minor, major)?

4. **Rollback Triggers**: What conditions should trigger automatic rollback vs manual rollback?

5. **Performance Validation**: What performance degradation thresholds are acceptable during upgrades?

6. **Environment Cleanup**: How should staging environments be cleaned up and reset between tests?
