# PBI-12: Lean Upgrade Infrastructure with Distributed Development Support

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-12)

## Overview

This PBI establishes lean upgrade infrastructure with automated testing to validate framework upgrades in staging before production deployment with quick rollback capability. The infrastructure supports distributed development workflows, allowing development and testing on laptop while maintaining reliable deployment to production server. The solution uses simplified GitOps + Docker Compose patterns optimized for single semi-technical developer maintenance.

## Problem Statement

Framework upgrades require careful validation to ensure system stability and functionality. Additionally, the development workflow needs to support distributed development where new features and upgrades are developed and tested on a separate laptop while maintaining production services on the server. Without proper upgrade infrastructure, the system faces significant risks:

- Framework upgrades may be deployed without proper testing, leading to production failures
- No staging environment for upgrade validation may result in untested deployments
- Lack of automated workflow validation may miss critical functionality issues
- No database migration testing may cause data corruption or loss
- Missing rollback capability may result in extended downtime during upgrade failures
- No distributed development support may limit development flexibility and testing capabilities
- Complex infrastructure may be difficult to maintain for single developer teams

## User Stories

**Primary Actor: DevOps Engineer**
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a staging environment for testing upgrades so that I can validate changes before production deployment
- As a DevOps engineer, I want to develop and test on my laptop so that I can work independently while production runs on the server
- As a DevOps engineer, I want automated workflow validation so that I can ensure critical workflows function correctly after upgrades
- As a DevOps engineer, I want database migration testing so that I can validate data integrity during upgrades
- As a DevOps engineer, I want rollback capability within 5 minutes so that I can quickly recover from failed upgrades
- As a DevOps engineer, I want simple, maintainable infrastructure so that I can manage upgrades without complex tooling

**Secondary Actors:**
- **System Administrator**: Needs confidence that upgrades won't break production systems
- **Product Owner**: Needs assurance that user-facing features work after upgrades
- **Support Engineer**: Needs quick rollback capability to minimize user impact
- **Developer**: Needs ability to develop and test features independently on laptop

## Technical Approach

### Simplified Distributed Development Architecture
- **GitOps + Docker Compose**: Single unified approach using Git as source of truth and Docker Compose for orchestration
- **Environment Portability**: Staging environment works on both laptop and server with environment-specific configuration
- **Data Synchronization**: Simple file-based data sync between production and staging environments
- **Automated Testing**: Lightweight automated testing using shell scripts and Docker
- **Rapid Rollback**: Simple rollback procedures using Git and Docker Compose

### Core Components

#### 1. Environment Templates and Configuration
- **Docker Compose Templates**: Standardized `docker-compose.staging.yml` for consistent staging environments
- **Environment Variables**: Environment-specific `.env` files (`.env.production`, `.env.staging`, `.env.laptop`)
- **Configuration Management**: Simple shell scripts for environment detection and configuration injection
- **Portability**: Same configuration works on laptop and server with appropriate overrides

#### 2. Data Synchronization
- **Database Dumps**: Simple PostgreSQL dumps for database synchronization
- **File Sync**: rsync-based file synchronization for uploads and static data
- **Data Sanitization**: Optional data sanitization for sensitive information on laptop
- **Incremental Updates**: Support for incremental data updates to keep staging current

#### 3. Automated Testing and Validation
- **Health Checks**: Docker-based health checks for service validation
- **Workflow Testing**: Shell script-based testing of critical user workflows
- **Integration Testing**: Simple API and service integration validation
- **Performance Validation**: Basic performance checks and resource monitoring

#### 4. Deployment and Rollback
- **Git-based Deployment**: Use Git branches and tags for version management
- **Automated Scripts**: Shell scripts for deployment, promotion, and rollback
- **Backup and Restore**: Simple file-based backup and restore procedures
- **Validation Pipeline**: Automated validation before production deployment

### Technology Stack
- **Git**: Version control and deployment coordination
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration and environment management
- **Shell Scripts**: Automation and deployment procedures
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with pg_dump/pg_restore for data sync
- **rsync**: File synchronization between environments

## UX/UI Considerations

### Simplified Command-Line Interface
- Clear command-line scripts with progress indicators and status messages
- Simple confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Color-coded output for success, warning, and error states
- Help text and usage examples for all scripts
- Logging to files for audit trail and debugging

### Environment Management
- Simple script commands for environment operations (`deploy-staging.sh`, `promote-to-production.sh`)
- Environment status checking and health validation
- Data synchronization progress indicators
- Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- Environment cleanup and reset capabilities

### Development Workflow
- Clear documentation for laptop vs server development
- Simple Git workflow for feature development and testing
- Automated validation before production deployment
- Quick rollback procedures with clear status reporting
- Development environment setup and maintenance guides
