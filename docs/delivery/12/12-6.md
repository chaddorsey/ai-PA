# [12-6] E2E CoS Test

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Comprehensive end-to-end validation to ensure all PBI 12 acceptance criteria are met and the simplified distributed development upgrade infrastructure provides complete staging testing and rapid rollback capabilities. This final validation ensures all components work together correctly across laptop and server environments.
