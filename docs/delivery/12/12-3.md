# [12-3] Build Automated Testing and Validation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Develop shell script-based testing for workflows, health checks, and validation procedures. This provides lightweight but effective automated testing that validates critical functionality during upgrades without requiring complex testing frameworks.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Health check scripts for service validation
- Critical workflow testing using shell scripts
- API endpoint validation and compatibility testing
- Basic performance validation and resource monitoring
- Automated validation before production deployment

### Technical Requirements
- Shell script-based testing framework
- Docker-based health checks for service validation
- HTTP client testing for API validation
- Resource monitoring and validation scripts
- Test result reporting and logging

### Testing Requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical workflows
- Automated test execution in staging environment
- Test result reporting and analysis
- Test failure detection and alerting
- Simple test maintenance and update procedures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Health Check Scripts
1. Create Docker-based health check scripts for all services
2. Implement service availability and responsiveness testing
3. Create health check aggregation and reporting
4. Implement health check scheduling and automation
5. Test health checks on both laptop and server environments

### Phase 2: Workflow Testing
1. Create shell script-based workflow testing framework
2. Implement critical user workflow testing
3. Create API endpoint testing and validation
4. Implement integration testing between services
5. Test workflow testing on staging environments

### Phase 3: Performance Validation
1. Create resource monitoring and validation scripts
2. Implement performance baseline establishment
3. Create performance regression testing
4. Implement performance alerting and reporting
5. Test performance validation on different environments

### Phase 4: Test Automation and Integration
1. Create unified test execution scripts
2. Implement test result reporting and analysis
3. Create test failure detection and alerting
4. Implement test integration with deployment procedures
5. Create test maintenance and update procedures

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that automated testing and validation provides comprehensive coverage for critical functionality using shell script-based approach
- **Test Scope**: Health checks, workflow testing, API validation, performance testing, and test automation
- **Environment & Setup**: Staging environment with automated testing deployed
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Health Checks**: Service health checks work correctly and provide accurate status
  2. **Workflow Testing**: Critical workflow testing validates functionality correctly
  3. **API Validation**: API endpoint testing and validation works correctly
  4. **Performance Testing**: Performance validation and monitoring works correctly
  5. **Test Automation**: Automated test execution and reporting works correctly
- **Success Criteria**: Health checks are accurate, workflow testing is comprehensive, API validation is complete, performance testing is effective, test automation is reliable
