# [12-1] Deploy Staging Environment Infrastructure

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create an isolated staging environment with automated provisioning, production-like configuration, and data synchronization capabilities. This staging environment will serve as the testing ground for all framework upgrades before production deployment.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Isolated staging environment with production-like configuration
- Automated staging environment provisioning and configuration
- Production data synchronization for realistic testing scenarios
- Staging environment lifecycle management and automation
- Staging environment monitoring and health validation

### Technical Requirements
- Docker-based staging environment with service isolation
- Automated environment provisioning and configuration scripts
- Data synchronization mechanisms between production and staging
- Environment cleanup and reset capabilities
- Staging environment monitoring and health checks

### Isolation Requirements
- Complete isolation from production environment
- Network isolation and security controls
- Data isolation with separate databases and storage
- Service isolation with independent service instances
- Configuration isolation with staging-specific settings

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Staging Environment Design
1. Design staging environment architecture and infrastructure requirements
2. Define staging environment configuration and service specifications
3. Create staging environment provisioning and automation requirements
4. Design data synchronization and management procedures
5. Create staging environment monitoring and health check specifications

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment
1. Deploy staging environment infrastructure and services
2. Configure staging environment networking and security
3. Set up staging environment databases and storage
4. Configure staging environment services and applications
5. Implement staging environment monitoring and health checks

### Phase 3: Data Synchronization
1. Implement production data synchronization to staging
2. Create data synchronization scheduling and automation
3. Set up data synchronization monitoring and validation
4. Implement data synchronization cleanup and management
5. Create data synchronization testing and validation procedures

### Phase 4: Environment Management
1. Implement staging environment lifecycle management
2. Create environment provisioning and configuration automation
3. Set up environment cleanup and reset capabilities
4. Implement environment monitoring and health validation
5. Create environment management documentation and procedures

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that staging environment infrastructure is properly deployed and provides isolated, production-like testing environment
- **Test Scope**: Environment provisioning, data synchronization, service isolation, and management automation
- **Environment & Setup**: Staging environment deployed with all services and data synchronization configured
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Environment Provisioning**: Staging environment can be provisioned and configured automatically
  2. **Data Synchronization**: Production data is synchronized to staging correctly and regularly
  3. **Service Isolation**: Staging services are completely isolated from production
  4. **Environment Management**: Environment lifecycle management works correctly
  5. **Monitoring**: Staging environment monitoring and health checks work correctly
- **Success Criteria**: Staging environment is fully functional, data synchronization works correctly, service isolation is complete, environment management is automated
