# [12-1] Create Portable Staging Environment

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a portable staging environment using Docker Compose templates and environment-specific configuration that works on both laptop and server. This staging environment will serve as the testing ground for all framework upgrades before production deployment, supporting distributed development workflows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Portable staging environment that works on both laptop and server
- Environment-specific configuration using `.env` files
- Automated staging environment provisioning using shell scripts
- Production data synchronization for realistic testing scenarios
- Environment detection and configuration injection
- Staging environment lifecycle management and automation

### Technical Requirements
- Docker Compose-based staging environment with `docker-compose.staging.yml`
- Environment-specific configuration files (`.env.production`, `.env.staging`, `.env.laptop`)
- Shell scripts for environment provisioning and management
- Environment detection and configuration injection
- Simple health checks and validation procedures

### Portability Requirements
- Same Docker Compose configuration works on laptop and server
- Environment-specific overrides for different deployment targets
- Resource constraints handling for laptop environments
- Network configuration adaptation for different environments
- Clear documentation for environment setup and maintenance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Docker Compose Templates
1. Create `docker-compose.staging.yml` based on production configuration
2. Design environment-specific configuration structure
3. Create environment variable templates and examples
4. Implement resource constraints for laptop environments
5. Test staging environment on both laptop and server

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration
1. Create `.env.production` for production environment
2. Create `.env.staging` for staging environment
3. Create `.env.laptop` for laptop-specific overrides
4. Implement environment detection and configuration injection
5. Create configuration validation and testing

### Phase 3: Provisioning Scripts
1. Create `deploy-staging.sh` for staging environment deployment
2. Create `configure-environment.sh` for environment detection and setup
3. Create `health-check.sh` for service validation
4. Create `cleanup-staging.sh` for environment reset
5. Test all scripts on both laptop and server

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing
1. Create environment setup documentation
2. Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
3. Test complete workflow on both environments
4. Create maintenance procedures and scripts
5. Validate portability and consistency

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that portable staging environment works correctly on both laptop and server with appropriate configuration
- **Test Scope**: Environment provisioning, configuration injection, portability, and management automation
- **Environment & Setup**: Staging environment deployed on both laptop and server with environment-specific configuration
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Environment Provisioning**: Staging environment can be provisioned on both laptop and server
  2. **Configuration Injection**: Environment-specific configuration is applied correctly
  3. **Portability**: Same Docker Compose configuration works on different environments
  4. **Resource Constraints**: Laptop environment respects resource limitations
  5. **Health Checks**: Service validation works correctly on both environments
- **Success Criteria**: Staging environment is fully functional on both laptop and server, configuration injection works correctly, portability is maintained
