# [12-4] Create Deployment and Rollback Scripts

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build Git-based deployment and 5-minute rollback capabilities using simple shell scripts. This provides reliable deployment and rollback procedures optimized for single developer maintenance while supporting distributed development workflows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Git-based deployment using branches and tags for version management
- 5-minute rollback capability using Git and Docker Compose
- Automated deployment scripts for staging and production
- Backup and restore procedures for data and configuration
- Deployment validation and testing procedures

### Technical Requirements
- Shell script-based deployment and rollback automation
- Git repository for version control and deployment coordination
- Docker Compose for service orchestration and management
- File-based backup and restore procedures
- Simple validation and testing scripts

### Performance Requirements
- Deployment execution within reasonable time limits
- Rollback execution within 5 minutes for all scenarios
- Minimal downtime during deployment and rollback procedures
- Data integrity validation during operations
- Service availability validation after operations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Git Workflow Design
1. Design Git branching strategy for distributed development
2. Create deployment and rollback workflow specifications
3. Define backup and restore procedures
4. Create version tagging and release management
5. Test Git workflow on both laptop and server

### Phase 2: Deployment Scripts
1. Create `deploy-staging.sh` for staging environment deployment
2. Create `promote-to-production.sh` for production deployment
3. Create `backup-production.sh` for backup procedures
4. Create `validate-deployment.sh` for deployment validation
5. Test deployment scripts on both environments

### Phase 3: Rollback Scripts
1. Create `rollback.sh` for rapid rollback procedures
2. Create `restore-from-backup.sh` for backup restoration
3. Create `validate-rollback.sh` for rollback validation
4. Create `emergency-rollback.sh` for critical situations
5. Test rollback scripts and procedures

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. Integrate deployment and rollback with staging environment
2. Create end-to-end testing procedures
3. Implement error handling and recovery procedures
4. Create monitoring and logging for operations
5. Test complete workflow on both laptop and server

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that Git-based deployment and rollback scripts provide reliable deployment and 5-minute rollback capability
- **Test Scope**: Deployment scripts, rollback procedures, backup/restore, validation, and Git workflow
- **Environment & Setup**: Both laptop and server environments with deployment and rollback scripts
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Deployment**: Staging and production deployment scripts work correctly
  2. **Rollback**: Rollback procedures complete within 5 minutes
  3. **Backup/Restore**: Backup and restore procedures work correctly
  4. **Validation**: Deployment and rollback validation works correctly
  5. **Git Workflow**: Git-based version management works correctly
- **Success Criteria**: Deployment is reliable, rollback is fast and effective, backup/restore works correctly, validation is comprehensive
