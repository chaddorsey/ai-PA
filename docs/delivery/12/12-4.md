4. Implement configuration consistency validation and recovery
5. Create data and configuration rollback testing and validation

### Phase 4: Service Rollback and Recovery
1. Implement service rollback and recovery procedures
2. Create service rollback coordination and orchestration
3. Set up service rollback monitoring and validation
4. Implement service rollback testing and validation
5. Create service rollback documentation and procedures

### Phase 5: Rollback Validation and Testing
1. Implement comprehensive rollback testing and validation
2. Create rollback scenario testing and validation
3. Set up rollback performance testing and validation
4. Implement rollback failure testing and recovery procedures
5. Create rollback validation documentation and procedures

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that rapid rollback infrastructure provides 5-minute rollback capability for all upgrade scenarios with minimal downtime and data loss
- **Test Scope**: Rollback triggers, data rollback, configuration rollback, service rollback, and validation procedures
- **Environment & Setup**: Staging environment with rollback infrastructure deployed and tested
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Rollback Triggers**: Automated rollback triggers work correctly for all failure scenarios
  2. **Data Rollback**: Data rollback and recovery procedures work correctly within 5 minutes
  3. **Configuration Rollback**: Configuration rollback and recovery procedures work correctly
  4. **Service Rollback**: Service rollback and recovery procedures work correctly
  5. **Validation**: Rollback validation and testing procedures work correctly
- **Success Criteria**: Rollback capability within 5 minutes, data and configuration rollback works correctly, service rollback is effective, rollback validation is comprehensive
