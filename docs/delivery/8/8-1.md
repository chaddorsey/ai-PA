# [8-1] Establish Testing Framework Infrastructure

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Set up the foundational testing infrastructure that supports unit, integration, and end-to-end testing capabilities for the PA ecosystem. This includes creating the testing framework structure, configuration, and basic test execution environment.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Establish testing framework structure with separate directories for unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Configure test execution environment with proper isolation and cleanup
- Set up test data management and fixture handling
- Implement basic test reporting and logging capabilities
- Create test configuration files for different test types and environments

### Technical Requirements
- Use Jest for unit testing (TypeScript/JavaScript components)
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing (browser automation)
- Use pytest for Python component testing
- Docker-based test environment isolation
- Test results exportable in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, JUnit)

### Performance Requirements
- Test framework startup time < 30 seconds
- Individual test execution with proper timeout handling
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Memory-efficient test data management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Framework Structure
1. Create test directory structure:
   - `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
   - `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for service interactions
   - `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end workflow tests
   - `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and fixtures
   - `tests/utils/` - Test utilities and helpers

2. Set up package.json scripts for test execution
3. Configure Jest for TypeScript testing
4. Configure Playwright for E2E testing
5. Set up pytest configuration for Python components

### Phase 2: Test Environment
1. Create Docker Compose configuration for test environment
2. Set up test database with proper schema and fixtures
3. Configure test environment variables and secrets
4. Implement test environment cleanup procedures
5. Set up test logging and monitoring

### Phase 3: Test Utilities
1. Create common test utilities and helpers
2. Implement test data generation and management
3. Set up test result reporting and export
4. Create test execution scripts and automation
5. Implement test environment health checks

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that the testing framework infrastructure is properly established and functional
- **Test Scope**: Framework setup, test execution, and basic reporting
- **Environment & Setup**: Clean Docker environment with test configuration
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. Framework can be initialized successfully
  2. Unit tests can be executed with Jest
  3. E2E tests can be executed with Playwright
  4. Python tests can be executed with pytest
  5. Test results are properly reported and exported
  6. Test environment cleanup works correctly
- **Success Criteria**: All test execution commands work without errors, results are properly formatted and exported

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Add test scripts and dependencies
- `tests/` - New directory structure for all test types
- `tests/jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- `tests/playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `tests/pytest.ini` - pytest configuration
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Test environment Docker configuration
- `tests/utils/` - Test utilities and helpers
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and fixtures
