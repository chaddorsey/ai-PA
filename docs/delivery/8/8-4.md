## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Generate synthetic test data for all services and components
- Implement test data isolation and cleanup procedures
- Create test data consistency validation tools
- Support test data versioning and management
- Implement test data security and privacy controls

### Technical Requirements
- Test data generation for databases (PostgreSQL, Supabase)
- Test data for external services (Gmail, Slack, APIs)
- Test data for MCP servers and integrations
- Test data for Letta memory and configuration
- Test data for network and communication scenarios

### Data Requirements
- Realistic but anonymized data sets
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error conditions and malformed data
- Large data sets for performance testing
- Multi-language and special character support

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Generation Framework
1. Create test data generation utilities and templates
2. Implement synthetic data generators for each service
3. Create test data validation and verification tools
4. Set up test data versioning and storage
5. Implement test data security and anonymization

### Phase 2: Service-Specific Data Sets
1. Database test data (users, configurations, logs)
2. Gmail MCP test data (emails, contacts, labels)
3. Slackbot test data (messages, channels, users)
4. RAG MCP test data (documents, embeddings, queries)
5. Letta test data (memory, conversations, tools)

### Phase 3: Data Management Procedures
1. Implement test data setup and teardown procedures
2. Create test data isolation mechanisms
3. Set up automated test data cleanup
4. Implement test data consistency checks
5. Create test data backup and restore procedures

### Phase 4: Advanced Data Scenarios
1. Create edge case and boundary condition data
2. Implement error condition and malformed data sets
3. Create large data sets for performance testing
4. Implement multi-tenant and multi-user scenarios
5. Create data migration and transformation test data

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that test data management system provides reliable, consistent, and secure test data
- **Test Scope**: Data generation, management, isolation, and cleanup procedures
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with data generation tools and isolated test databases
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic data creation for all services
  2. **Data Isolation**: Test data separation and cleanup verification
  3. **Data Consistency**: Validation of data integrity and relationships
  4. **Data Security**: Anonymization and privacy protection verification
  5. **Data Management**: Setup, teardown, and versioning procedures
- **Success Criteria**: All test data is properly generated, isolated, and cleaned up; data consistency is maintained; security requirements are met
