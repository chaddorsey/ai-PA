[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Design and implement comprehensive test scenarios for all major PA workflows, including Letta core functionality, MCP integrations, data flow validation, and network communication testing.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Test scenarios for Letta agent initialization and core workflows
- MCP server integration tests (Gmail, RAG, Slackbot, etc.)
- Database operation and data consistency validation
- Network communication and service discovery testing
- Cross-service data flow and synchronization tests

### Technical Requirements
- Test scenarios must be automated and repeatable
- Tests should validate both success and failure paths
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test data should be isolated and cleanupable
- Tests should provide clear failure diagnostics

### Coverage Requirements
- All critical user workflows covered
- Edge cases and error conditions tested
- Service integration points validated
- Data persistence and retrieval verified
- Network resilience scenarios tested

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Letta Core Workflow Tests
1. Agent initialization and configuration tests
2. Memory management and persistence tests
3. Tool execution and response handling tests
4. Error handling and recovery tests
5. Performance and resource usage tests

### Phase 2: MCP Integration Tests
1. Gmail MCP server integration tests
2. RAG MCP server integration tests
3. Slackbot MCP integration tests
4. Health check and availability tests
5. Data format and protocol validation tests

### Phase 3: Data Flow Tests
1. Database operation tests (CRUD operations)
2. Cross-service data synchronization tests
3. Data consistency and integrity tests
4. Backup and restore validation tests
5. Transaction and rollback tests

### Phase 4: Network Communication Tests
1. Service discovery and DNS resolution tests
2. Internal network communication tests
3. External API integration tests
4. Connection failure and recovery tests
5. Load balancing and failover tests

## Verification

### Test Plan
- **Objective**: Verify that all major PA workflows function correctly through comprehensive test scenarios
- **Test Scope**: Core workflows, MCP integrations, data flow, and network communication
- **Environment & Setup**: Test environment with all services running and proper test data
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external APIs (Gmail, Slack) but use real internal services for integration testing
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  1. **Letta Workflows**: Agent startup, memory operations, tool execution, error handling
  2. **MCP Integration**: Each MCP server connection, data exchange, error handling
  3. **Data Flow**: Database operations, cross-service sync, data consistency
  4. **Network**: Service discovery, internal communication, external API calls
  5. **Error Scenarios**: Service failures, network issues, data corruption, timeout handling
- **Success Criteria**: All workflow test scenarios pass consistently, failures provide actionable diagnostics
