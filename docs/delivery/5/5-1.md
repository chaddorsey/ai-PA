# 5-1 Analyze current Slackbot implementation and identify containerization requirements

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Analyze the existing Slackbot application to understand its architecture, dependencies, configuration requirements, and identify what needs to be done to containerize it properly. This analysis will inform the Dockerfile creation and MCP server interface implementation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Code Analysis**: Review all Python files in the Slackbot application
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify all required Python packages and system dependencies
3. **Configuration Analysis**: Understand environment variables and configuration files
4. **Architecture Analysis**: Understand the application structure and entry points
5. **Integration Points**: Identify how the app connects to Slack and other services

### Technical Requirements
1. **Python Version**: Determine required Python version
2. **System Dependencies**: Identify any system-level packages needed
3. **File Structure**: Understand the application's file organization
4. **Environment Variables**: Document all required environment variables
5. **Port Requirements**: Identify what ports the application uses

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Structure Analysis
1. Review main application files (`app.py`, `app_oauth.py`)
2. Analyze the listeners structure and functionality
3. Review AI provider integrations
4. Examine state management implementation

### Phase 2: Dependency Analysis
1. Review `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`
2. Identify any missing dependencies
3. Check for version conflicts
4. Document system-level requirements

### Phase 3: Configuration Analysis
1. Review environment variable usage
2. Analyze configuration patterns
3. Identify secrets and sensitive data requirements
4. Document configuration file needs

### Phase 4: Integration Analysis
1. Understand Slack API integration patterns
2. Review Letta integration points
3. Analyze logging and error handling
4. Identify health check requirements

## Verification
