00:00:00\.000 \-\-\> 00:00:01\.070

Chad Dorsey: So I'm gonna…

2

00:00:01\.760 \-\-\> 00:00:14\.970

Chad Dorsey: So yes, I'm thrilled to connect, at least just to get, you know, connected, initially, and, probably a placeholder for more conversation as well.

3

00:00:15\.290 \-\-\> 00:00:28\.079

Chad Dorsey: So, I can briefly sort of describe us and where we stand in the scheme of things, and mostly want to hear more about Publishing Partners and, you know, how you've…

4

00:00:28\.200 \-\-\> 00:00:35\.190

Chad Dorsey: How you've worked with different kinds of groups and, you know, use that as a jumping\-off point to think about if there's, you know, more conversation to be had.

5

00:00:35\.190 \-\-\> 00:00:48\.770

Chad Dorsey: So you may or may not know our background. We are a nonprofit organization in Concord, Massachusetts, which is, I think, not that far from where you are, probably, right now. You're in Acton, or in Concord.

6

00:00:48\.770 \-\-\> 00:00:50\.110

Christine Tridente: Hudson. So, yep, close.

7

00:00:50\.110 \-\-\> 00:01:09\.709

Chad Dorsey: Okay, yep, so I live in Acton, you know, I'm sitting… Okay. Most days, I'm sitting in my basement in Acton, so, so nearby. And we've been around as an organization about 30, 30\-some years, 31 years now, and always focused on,

8

00:01:09\.710 \-\-\> 00:01:15\.219

Chad Dorsey: technology for STEM education, and thinking about what it can do.

9

00:01:15\.230 \-\-\> 00:01:22\.039

Chad Dorsey: The large majority of our work has been federally funded through NSF grants and others.

10

00:01:22\.350 \-\-\> 00:01:36\.290

Chad Dorsey: doing research on work, building things based upon research, etc. It's generally… we've made our work open source and open content in the past. We're thinking about that licensing, you know, trying to understand how to…

11

00:01:36\.290 \-\-\> 00:01:48\.489

Chad Dorsey: maintain the value proposition and brand promise for educators, but to think differently about that, for publishers and others going forward. Sure. And, let's see…

12

00:01:48\.680 \-\-\> 00:02:03\.920

Chad Dorsey: So we have a pretty significant sort of bodywork that's been developed over the years through that kind of, you know, grant process, tested and used in classrooms, many things that are used around the world, by, you know.

13

00:02:03\.920 \-\-\> 00:02:11\.289

Chad Dorsey: tens of thousands of, of teachers or more. We have some successful, research projects.

14

00:02:11\.290 \-\-\> 00:02:12\.620

Chad Dorsey: we have…

15

00:02:13\.580 \-\-\> 00:02:30\.630

Chad Dorsey: done some work, with industry and publisher, adjacent, or publishers, more as a… through a sort of work\-for\-hire model, so we have lots of things, models and simulations, you know, technology expertise that we develop, and so if you…

16

00:02:30\.700 \-\-\> 00:02:42\.890

Chad Dorsey: want a spate of simulations to accompany your K\-5 science curriculum. We have been able to come in as a vendor and connect with you and, you know, create things with our

17

00:02:42\.890 \-\-\> 00:02:52\.410

Chad Dorsey: Our existing content that, you know, work for you and extend our open source libraries and get paid on a sort of one\-time, you know, work\-for\-hire basis on…

18

00:02:52\.410 \-\-\> 00:02:52\.730

Christine Tridente: Sure.

19

00:02:52\.730 \-\-\> 00:02:53\.540

Chad Dorsey: kind of work.

20

00:02:53\.680 \-\-\> 00:03:01\.279

Chad Dorsey: We continue to do some work in that direction, but we also have

21

00:03:01\.410 \-\-\> 00:03:19\.579

Chad Dorsey: things that are fairly meaningful, objects that come out of our work. So, there might be a tool for data science, education, data exploration that is, you know, loved and used in many places, and, you know, could be

22

00:03:19\.580 \-\-\> 00:03:29\.080

Chad Dorsey: the foundation for significant, you know, sort of education work that publishers might be interested in, or an environment for,

23

00:03:29\.080 \-\-\> 00:03:39\.659

Chad Dorsey: for, you know, STEM teaching and learning, that's a kind of whole package environment that teachers and students sort of interact within, and we think has more…

24

00:03:39\.660 \-\-\> 00:03:54\.760

Chad Dorsey: sorts of tools and features than existing environments, is more collaborative, etc. And we also have lots of content that are… that's research\-based and, you know, well\-proven, much in the… mostly in the supplementary category, so…

25

00:03:54\.760 \-\-\> 00:04:02\.010

Chad Dorsey: really solid 3 weeks on plate tectonics with interactive materials, etc. We do have a

26

00:04:02\.110 \-\-\> 00:04:13\.670

Chad Dorsey: something that's a semester\-long, sort of course that we've developed together with Michigan State, but that's about the only thing that's sort of that grain size.

27

00:04:13\.670 \-\-\> 00:04:14\.160

Christine Tridente: Yep.

28

00:04:14\.510 \-\-\> 00:04:30\.480

Chad Dorsey: And, you know, so, as we're looking forward, we are thinking about opportunities and, options, and recognizing that, there are some things we do well, and other things that we have never learned to do, and may not want to learn to do.

29

00:04:30\.480 \-\-\> 00:04:32\.930

Chad Dorsey: So, lots of our stuff is in…

30

00:04:32\.930 \-\-\> 00:04:56\.429

Chad Dorsey: a sort of solid research, you know, state, where it's been piloted for a few years with classrooms, people love it and, you know, can work with it, but productization has not been fully into the sentence. Or it might actually be closer than we think, but sales, marketing are not really our bailiwick, so we are trying to think about

31

00:04:56\.470 \-\-\> 00:05:13\.510

Chad Dorsey: a, you know, even how might we discover if there are products that we had here that might or might not be, you know, our connection, that maybe that's on us, I don't know. But if, you know, if and as we do discover, oh, okay, there's a thing here, or we could combine those two things to be something that was really meaningful.

32

00:05:13\.510 \-\-\> 00:05:30\.189

Chad Dorsey: then we go, okay, now what do we do with that? So, you know, that was where, you know, the introduction came, to say, you know what? That's what these guys, you know, sort of do. So, that's me presuming, you know, the first half of your sentence, but you finish it correctly for me, and we'll go from there.

33

00:05:30\.190 \-\-\> 00:05:30\.690

Jennifer Hodges: Nice.

34

00:05:30\.690 \-\-\> 00:05:33\.229

Christine Tridente: Great, thank you. That's a great introduction.

35

00:05:33\.230 \-\-\> 00:05:34\.279

Jennifer Hodges: Really helpful, yeah.

36

00:05:34\.900 \-\-\> 00:05:44\.940

Christine Tridente: orbit, sort of, each other… I mean, you know, we've… it just got very dark. We've traveled in the same orbit, I think, for quite some time, being relatively local to each other. We are… we have…

37

00:05:44\.990 \-\-\> 00:05:59\.140

Christine Tridente: virtual high school as a client, you know, we know a lot of the same people. Yes, yeah. So, we have known of you for quite some time. It's nice to finally have a chance to… to talk about what we do, and I think what you described as sort of…

38

00:05:59\.360 \-\-\> 00:06:10\.319

Christine Tridente: going into publishers on a work\-for\-hire as a vendor. You know, we are fully a vendor, no quotes needed, that is what we do. We were founded in 2002, so at the sort of…

39

00:06:10\.510 \-\-\> 00:06:15\.350

Christine Tridente: The beginnings of, more, you know, layperson…

40

00:06:16\.030 \-\-\> 00:06:32\.659

Christine Tridente: technology use in the classroom, as… so we are… we are editorial, we are content, and there was, you know, one of our two founders saw a need for people who were… so at the time, you know, what was happening was big spreadsheets.

41

00:06:32\.800 \-\-\> 00:06:46\.580

Christine Tridente: were getting burned onto CDs and locked into the back of a book, and that was like, oh my god, it was groundbreaking, and editors were freaking out about it because they didn't know… you know, I mean, essentially, it was the beginnings, it was metadata, and it was just… everybody was using Excel, and these spreadsheets were ginormous, and…

42

00:06:46\.640 \-\-\> 00:06:54\.330

Christine Tridente: It was, you know, the beginning of, like, modularity and make your own, you know, put… letting teachers sort of put things together in the way that works for them, and it was…

43

00:06:54\.480 \-\-\> 00:06:55\.040

Chad Dorsey: Right.

44

00:06:55\.260 \-\-\> 00:07:14\.799

Christine Tridente: you know, intimidating to a lot of editorial folks who'd been making textbooks for 30 years, knew their content inside and out, but were hesitant slash resistant, you know, wherever they were in that continuum. And so, we are writers, editors, you know, instructional designers, subject matter experts for digital media, which.

45

00:07:14\.800 \-\-\> 00:07:15\.330

Chad Dorsey: Awesome.

46

00:07:15\.730 \-\-\> 00:07:22\.240

Christine Tridente: In and of itself is a huge continuum, because sometimes our clients will say, well, we know you don't do print, so we're not sitting down

47

00:07:22\.650 \-\-\> 00:07:30\.049

Christine Tridente: laying out pages in InDesign, you know, worrying about real estate and all of that, but, like, do you guys do PDFs? Well.

48

00:07:30\.170 \-\-\> 00:07:32\.059

Christine Tridente: Sure, you know, and so…

49

00:07:32\.060 \-\-\> 00:07:32\.920

Chad Dorsey: So it's…

50

00:07:32\.920 \-\-\> 00:07:33\.480

Christine Tridente: Even sleeping.

51

00:07:33\.480 \-\-\> 00:07:34\.590

Jennifer Hodges: And yet, yeah.

52

00:07:34\.590 \-\-\> 00:07:41\.800

Christine Tridente: Right, so it's… A little squishy, but it's that, you know, instructional design, pedagogical.

53

00:07:42\.110 \-\-\> 00:07:55\.889

Christine Tridente: knowledge of how, you know, what can you expect a kindergartner to drag and drop? How many things, you know, so there's that sort of fine motor piece overlaid on top of… but the standard says the kids have to write the number 2\. How do we…

54

00:07:56\.310 \-\-\> 00:08:04\.800

Christine Tridente: really hit that standard using this whatever platform our client has said we are using, and so it's kind of, you know… and at the end of the day, we're…

55

00:08:05\.270 \-\-\> 00:08:16\.690

Christine Tridente: subject matter experts, so it's… it's sort of nuanced once you get into it, I think, more so than some of our clients might realize at first, and so a lot of what we do is speccing animations, or…

56

00:08:17\.400 \-\-\> 00:08:28\.799

Christine Tridente: games and videos, some of it is, you know, writing tech\-enhanced, high\-stakes test items, lots of metadata still that has only gotten… those spreadsheets have only grown since

57

00:08:29\.560 \-\-\> 00:08:34\.980

Christine Tridente: Yeah. You know, alignments and, and…

58

00:08:35\.100 \-\-\> 00:08:54\.309

Christine Tridente: On the other end, it's QA\-ing all the stuff that went into the system to make sure that what we spec'd actually came true. Often the people who are building the content are not subject matter experts, and so, you know, there's the need for the content people to revisit it again post\-build. Kind of all over the place, I'm kind of trying to give you concrete examples.

59

00:08:54\.310 \-\-\> 00:08:55\.389

Chad Dorsey: You're in our business.

60

00:08:55\.390 \-\-\> 00:08:58\.580

Christine Tridente: So you know what we do.

61

00:08:59\.470 \-\-\> 00:09:09\.739

Chad Dorsey: And is a project usually, you know, a textbook or a year course, what's the grain size of a thing that you take on as an object?

62

00:09:09\.740 \-\-\> 00:09:15\.260

Christine Tridente: That's a good question. We are fairly small. People are often surprised to learn how small we are. It means nothing to you at the moment.

63

00:09:15\.260 \-\-\> 00:09:18\.560

Chad Dorsey: because you don't know us, but we're only 6 people.

64

00:09:18\.900 \-\-\> 00:09:20\.740

Christine Tridente: So, it's not unusual.

65

00:09:21\.270 \-\-\> 00:09:29\.600

Christine Tridente: So, for example, we have two projects going on that are separated right now by two zeros. So it's… we can scale pretty…

66

00:09:29\.730 \-\-\> 00:09:31\.719

Christine Tridente: Sizably, we like.

67

00:09:32\.320 \-\-\> 00:09:43\.279

Christine Tridente: we… I don't think that we've ever said no to something because it was too small. We're much more likely to say no if something is bigger than we can accommodate in the schedule that the client wants.

68

00:09:43\.280 \-\-\> 00:09:43\.610

Chad Dorsey: sure.

69

00:09:43\.610 \-\-\> 00:09:58\.460

Christine Tridente: Because all of our internal people are subject matter experts, and so we're doing our thin slice internally, and then they're reviewing every bit of content that goes out to the team, and so our single, sort of, project director is our bottleneck, so we're kind of…

70

00:09:58\.470 \-\-\> 00:10:12\.769

Christine Tridente: essentially driven by the capacity of one person to turn around content on the client's schedule. If the client's coming to us, they're probably already slightly in trouble from a schedule perspective, so, you know, job security, that's what we…

71

00:10:13\.740 \-\-\> 00:10:26\.309

Christine Tridente: So, rarely, you know, does a client come to us and say, we need you to make an entire grade 3 science course, soup to nuts, that's rare, you know, sometimes they might come and

72

00:10:26\.960 \-\-\> 00:10:32\.759

Christine Tridente: It's not unusual, we call it the gnarly bits, for them to… maybe they're sending offshore.

73

00:10:32\.890 \-\-\> 00:10:42\.670

Christine Tridente: for… in a more… there are some vendors that are a bit more, maybe assembly line, and I don't mean that as a… as a dig on… on them.

74

00:10:43\.450 \-\-\> 00:10:53\.129

Christine Tridente: where less that and more, sort of, alright, let's figure this out. Some of the content is in the old platform. Some of the content is still in print, some of the content came from the Texas version.

75

00:10:53\.130 \-\-\> 00:10:53\.900

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, exactly.

76

00:10:53\.900 \-\-\> 00:10:56\.139

Christine Tridente: So, how do we get this all together?

77

00:10:56\.140 \-\-\> 00:11:00\.120

Jennifer Hodges: Where do we begin? Or, yeah, what needs to be reset?

78

00:11:00\.120 \-\-\> 00:11:01\.020

Christine Tridente: affect what.

79

00:11:01\.020 \-\-\> 00:11:02\.450

Jennifer Hodges: Can we dig in, can we?

80

00:11:02\.450 \-\-\> 00:11:03\.440

Christine Tridente: Right.

81

00:11:03\.860 \-\-\> 00:11:12\.330

Christine Tridente: So… and we also can do that assembly line, sort of, you know, here's a prototype, we now need 100 lessons, we can certainly do that, but…

82

00:11:13\.560 \-\-\> 00:11:16\.729

Christine Tridente: You know, and we also, we aren't competing with the offshore.

83

00:11:17\.020 \-\-\> 00:11:17\.680

Chad Dorsey: But…

84

00:11:17\.680 \-\-\> 00:11:21\.650

Christine Tridente: companies either, which is okay with us, so it's… people use the word, like.

85

00:11:21\.830 \-\-\> 00:11:28\.919

Christine Tridente: boutique, which makes me cringe, but I say it every time, and then I say, but it makes me cringe, but I say it, because it is…

86

00:11:28\.920 \-\-\> 00:11:30\.500

Jennifer Hodges: It's a good… it fits in a lot of ways.

87

00:11:30\.500 \-\-\> 00:11:31\.780

Christine Tridente: Right, right.

88

00:11:31\.780 \-\-\> 00:11:38\.119

Chad Dorsey: The niche, right, for the things that are… that require a little bit more thinking, or wisdom, or what have you, yep.

89

00:11:38\.120 \-\-\> 00:11:38\.820

Jennifer Hodges: Yes.

90

00:11:38\.820 \-\-\> 00:12:00\.110

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, because we've seen a lot, and we've been around, you know this as well, you've been around so long, we've seen a lot of platforms, and we've seen the special characters with Spanish or math crash something, and so because we're seeing that, and we're, you know, writing the manuscripts, the storyboard, the specs, whatever it is, if we're doing the content, you know, functionality review later, we're going, oh, I can see why that broke, or we can foresee that breaking.

91

00:12:00\.110 \-\-\> 00:12:00\.610

Chad Dorsey: What if we solve.

92

00:12:00\.610 \-\-\> 00:12:18\.719

Jennifer Hodges: for that or tested, and so we do get brought in a lot to say, you know, what platforms have you seen? Obviously, careful with NDAs and things like that, so that's the fun stuff, you know, but the other stuff, the kind of afternoon work, because Christine refers to it sometimes, of checking to make sure the audio file matches the script, you know, that's a little more straightforward, a little more, you know.

93

00:12:18\.910 \-\-\> 00:12:26\.880

Jennifer Hodges: check\-the\-box kind of assembly line, like you said. It all fits into the big picture, and it varies a lot, subjects and size of the projects.

94

00:12:27\.290 \-\-\> 00:12:45\.090

Chad Dorsey: And what's the… Of course, what's the gamut of your, sort of, subject matter? I mean, do you have a place where that starts or stops? Is it, you know, either grade level or certain subjects, or what have you? We're more STEM\-focused in general, but that doesn't… that only narrows things a little bit sometimes. True.

95

00:12:45\.090 \-\-\> 00:12:45\.760

Jennifer Hodges: That's true.

96

00:12:45\.760 \-\-\> 00:12:49\.030

Christine Tridente: Yes, so we are all K\-12\. Okay.

97

00:12:49\.320 \-\-\> 00:12:52\.700

Christine Tridente: A little bit, you know… Baby guys.

98

00:12:52\.850 \-\-\> 00:13:07\.070

Christine Tridente: And then a little bit sort of non\-major higher ed, and, you know, like, corporate upskilling or adult upskilling, we will get involved in. Sometimes we're called into… so one of our service categories we sort of talk about is authoring, which to us means

99

00:13:07\.550 \-\-\> 00:13:15\.670

Christine Tridente: Maybe we developed the content, maybe somebody else did, but now it needs to get into a certain format in order to be deployed or ingested.

100

00:13:15\.690 \-\-\> 00:13:34\.949

Christine Tridente: And, you know, maybe the internal editorial folks aren't so comfortable with that. It used to be, really, it was all spreadsheets, you know, then it was… it was QTI, it was XML, it was HTML, now it's, you know, you can author directly in the back end. A lot of clients will let us into the back end directly of their LMS, but sometimes the editorial people just don't want to be back there, which is…

101

00:13:35\.020 \-\-\> 00:13:44\.229

Christine Tridente: Fine. So we think of… we talk about that as authoring, because, you know, we're not writing the test item in that moment, we're sort of getting it where it needs to go, but there's…

102

00:13:44\.690 \-\-\> 00:13:46\.389

Christine Tridente: Almost never.

103

00:13:46\.590 \-\-\> 00:13:47\.590

Christine Tridente: not…

104

00:13:47\.820 \-\-\> 00:14:00\.969

Christine Tridente: you know, sort of editorial involved in that, and so that's where we fit nicely, because we are also… we are editorial, that's what we are first. You're not just copying and pasting it for 11 cents from Word doc into the tool that is never…

105

00:14:00\.970 \-\-\> 00:14:01\.310

Chad Dorsey: Right.

106

00:14:01\.310 \-\-\> 00:14:05\.219

Christine Tridente: Whatever in the history of time, how that has worked. And so…

107

00:14:05\.220 \-\-\> 00:14:06\.240

Jennifer Hodges: Well, anyway.

108

00:14:06\.240 \-\-\> 00:14:21\.289

Christine Tridente: Right. And so sometimes, you know, that will be where we might lay outside of a very specific subject matter expertise, is where a client says, we don't want… we need your editorial eye. We don't need you to know, you know, the ins and outs of automotive.

109

00:14:21\.290 \-\-\> 00:14:22\.060

Chad Dorsey: Right.

110

00:14:22\.060 \-\-\> 00:14:36\.549

Christine Tridente: engineering, just please get this… just know enough about editorial and the platform, which, even if we've never seen a platform before, chances are we have seen some 80% overlap with the last platform we were working in, and so that's… because that's what we do that.

111

00:14:37\.280 \-\-\> 00:14:39\.700

Christine Tridente: It's not a blocker for us, whereas for some it is.

112

00:14:39\.700 \-\-\> 00:14:40\.270

Chad Dorsey: That's okay.

113

00:14:40\.270 \-\-\> 00:14:41\.159

Christine Tridente: We just…

114

00:14:41\.600 \-\-\> 00:14:42\.190

Chad Dorsey: down.

115

00:14:42\.380 \-\-\> 00:14:46\.130

Chad Dorsey: And, and in what cases are you…

116

00:14:46\.130 \-\-\> 00:15:06\.340

Chad Dorsey: sort of providing the content, or pedagogy, hat, or… and… and not, you know, are there cases where you're saying, oh, I think this would be a great starter lesson, and then follow on with X and Y and Z, and is that different, you know, and in what ways is that different from the authoring editorial, and if so…

117

00:15:06\.870 \-\-\> 00:15:13\.060

Christine Tridente: Sure. So… Because everything we do is work for hire, that tends to happen as a…

118

00:15:13\.170 \-\-\> 00:15:20\.519

Christine Tridente: sort of a project in and of itself, and so we are sort of known for… we can't not see…

119

00:15:20\.520 \-\-\> 00:15:20\.840

Chad Dorsey: Right.

120

00:15:20\.840 \-\-\> 00:15:27\.750

Christine Tridente: what we see, and so we are often, you know, flagging things, and we're kind of… sometimes clients will have to say, can you please… we don't… could you please just…

121

00:15:28\.100 \-\-\> 00:15:28\.960

Jennifer Hodges: Say less.

122

00:15:28\.960 \-\-\> 00:15:30\.160

Christine Tridente: Exactly.

123

00:15:30\.160 \-\-\> 00:15:33\.090

Jennifer Hodges: Right? That sounds like next year's update.

124

00:15:33\.090 \-\-\> 00:15:34\.950

Christine Tridente: Exactly, that's the B print, we'll worry about that.

125

00:15:34\.950 \-\-\> 00:15:35\.700

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, make…

126

00:15:35\.700 \-\-\> 00:15:36\.330

Christine Tridente: we are…

127

00:15:36\.690 \-\-\> 00:15:41\.700

Christine Tridente: called in to do, sort of, road mapping, blueprinting, you know… Right.

128

00:15:41\.790 \-\-\> 00:15:58\.679

Christine Tridente: we have spent, actually, 3 days at a lodge in New Hampshire, kind of envisioning a brand new program, starting with the CCSS, and laying out the learning objectives, and developing a scope and sequence, and from there, the, you know, the TOC of the different levels, and really, that… I mean, that's… we don't get to do that as much as…

129

00:15:59\.020 \-\-\> 00:16:04\.299

Christine Tridente: We'd like to. I don't know that we're really thought of so much For that, but that's…

130

00:16:05\.000 \-\-\> 00:16:07\.389

Christine Tridente: That's good work if you can get it, and you know, often.

131

00:16:07\.390 \-\-\> 00:16:08\.279

Jennifer Hodges: I'm part of it.

132

00:16:08\.470 \-\-\> 00:16:11\.899

Christine Tridente: some piece of that, you know, so we have…

133

00:16:12\.080 \-\-\> 00:16:14\.549

Jennifer Hodges: Gap analysis, or… Yeah, go ahead.

134

00:16:14\.550 \-\-\> 00:16:26\.079

Christine Tridente: Right, or how do we want to… you know, we want to make individual, you know, SCORM objects. We have the budget to do 30\. Can you look at this program and pick a place where, you know, the 30 hardest concepts.

135

00:16:26\.080 \-\-\> 00:16:26\.580

Jennifer Hodges: that we.

136

00:16:26\.580 \-\-\> 00:16:33\.500

Christine Tridente: I want to learning objects for. So, you know, kind of… again, it's… we kind of dip in…

137

00:16:34\.480 \-\-\> 00:16:36\.609

Christine Tridente: We rarely get to just, sort of…

138

00:16:36\.610 \-\-\> 00:16:37\.110

Chad Dorsey: Earth.

139

00:16:37\.140 \-\-\> 00:16:38\.640

Christine Tridente: Yeah.

140

00:16:38\.640 \-\-\> 00:16:39\.630

Jennifer Hodges: the very beginning.

141

00:16:40\.180 \-\-\> 00:16:46\.269

Chad Dorsey: You know, so we would probably be the, you know, the group that has…

142

00:16:46\.330 \-\-\> 00:16:56\.480

Chad Dorsey: you know, SCORM objects that are of a type that, sort of, are more interesting than people have seen, or more versatile, or what have you.

143

00:16:56\.480 \-\-\> 00:17:19\.680

Chad Dorsey: Does that connect in with your connection with folks as well, or is it… those are two different worlds, and so, you know, it's… there's sort of… they're just saying, you know, give us holes, and we'll take care of, you know, filling those holes in, and, you know, we'll tell you when we're all done, and then you can help make sure that the… the figure number is correct, or something like that.

144

00:17:20\.760 \-\-\> 00:17:22\.169

Christine Tridente: No, I mean, we can…

145

00:17:22\.359 \-\-\> 00:17:31\.819

Christine Tridente: spec, you know, learning objects, or re\-spec, you know, sometimes they might say, can you start with these Texas ones and see what you can do for national, and so we might…

146

00:17:32\.200 \-\-\> 00:17:40\.519

Christine Tridente: take an existing, sort of, spec document and make it work, or write them from scratch. I think that's… I don't want to not answer your… I think that.

147

00:17:40\.520 \-\-\> 00:18:00\.050

Chad Dorsey: I'm thinking about the fact that we, you know, so we have a library of interactive technology, you know, things that you could think of as objects that would be, you know, interactive illustrations of concepts or exploration opportunities for, you know, for different kinds of things. And it's, you know.

148

00:18:00\.270 \-\-\> 00:18:19\.030

Chad Dorsey: we will look opportunistically for places in the publishing world where people are at the ready point to think about how to implement, you know, interactives that are more inquiry\-based than the things that they've been using, or what have you. You know, I don't…

149

00:18:19\.030 \-\-\> 00:18:23\.869

Chad Dorsey: I don't know if those are probably parallel worlds with what you're doing in your ways, right?

150

00:18:23\.870 \-\-\> 00:18:43\.810

Christine Tridente: Yes, we… it's not unusual for us to make those kinds of connections, because we are… we've been around a long time, and like you, and, you know, people often ask us, because they trust us, you know, do you know anybody who's doing this? But it's not, you know, we are not, as a business, sort of doing that marketing or… or those kinds of connections.

151

00:18:44\.100 \-\-\> 00:18:46\.320

Chad Dorsey: Right. And, or the…

152

00:18:46\.320 \-\-\> 00:19:03\.669

Jennifer Hodges: a couple of Boston nonprofits that we worked with, too, that had a library of assets like that, some static and some interactives, and we wrote, you know, because they knew they had a need, so again, not really what you're asking, that we wrote student activities and teacher materials around them so they could package that, aligned to, you know, so we developed that content at their.

153

00:19:03\.670 \-\-\> 00:19:04\.510

Chad Dorsey: Question.

154

00:19:04\.510 \-\-\> 00:19:05\.810

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, that came from them.

155

00:19:06\.520 \-\-\> 00:19:10\.739

Chad Dorsey: And there aren't cases, it sounds like, where,

156

00:19:10\.830 \-\-\> 00:19:25\.100

Chad Dorsey: there is content that is proven and valuable, and is looking for, you know, homes within other things, or would have… I mean, it sounds like you are either working with content that's been provided from the vendor, or

157

00:19:25\.100 \-\-\> 00:19:34\.880

Chad Dorsey: Or sort of speccing all places where it needs to be expanded on, but not, I've got a great unit for whatever, or I've got a… yeah, right.

158

00:19:35\.180 \-\-\> 00:19:38\.210

Christine Tridente: Right, so we're not… licensing. Right.

159

00:19:38\.210 \-\-\> 00:19:38\.610

Chad Dorsey: or…

160

00:19:38\.610 \-\-\> 00:19:39\.070

Jennifer Hodges: Right?

161

00:19:40\.310 \-\-\> 00:19:52\.939

Christine Tridente: Although, I mean, it's not unusual for… I don't think we've ever had people ask us for objects, necessarily. I mean, it's just an example, but it's not unusual for clients who… to come to us and ask us to source

162

00:19:53\.070 \-\-\> 00:20:02\.179

Christine Tridente: So I'm thinking of, item stimuli. You know, we are often either creating… so I'm thinking of a current project, you know, data sets.

163

00:20:02\.330 \-\-\> 00:20:05\.100

Christine Tridente: Or sourcing them, which often…

164

00:20:05\.610 \-\-\> 00:20:11\.909

Christine Tridente: It's easier to just create sort of a faux study than to go find one that's public domain.

165

00:20:12\.630 \-\-\> 00:20:16\.770

Christine Tridente: So that's… I'm trying to think, you know, stimuli, which is…

166

00:20:17\.110 \-\-\> 00:20:17\.660

Chad Dorsey: Right.

167

00:20:17\.660 \-\-\> 00:20:35\.790

Christine Tridente: Datasets is a current thing we're doing, you know, often it's art or, reading passages or primary sources. I don't know that we've ever been asked to do that for, you know, sort of objects, but that isn't out of the realm of, you know, now that we're sort of having this conversation, out of the realm of possibility that we would.

168

00:20:35\.790 \-\-\> 00:20:36\.550

Chad Dorsey: We just…

169

00:20:36\.550 \-\-\> 00:20:49\.420

Christine Tridente: haven't yet. That's sort of a… and I don't imagine that would ever be a public domain… Right. …situation, that there's just… your beautiful objects are out there for any… although you did mention they were open source, so maybe I'm making assumptions.

170

00:20:49\.420 \-\-\> 00:21:05\.610

Chad Dorsey: Well, I mean, yeah, we're slowly running into the issue that people are finding that and sort of saying, oh, I could just take it on with this, so that's a different conversation, but, you know, but that is also a signal that people… I mean, so I think both of… both parts of that sentence are…

171

00:21:05\.740 \-\-\> 00:21:24\.730

Chad Dorsey: are meaningful, which is that, you know, until recently, that hasn't been the case, but more often… but occasionally now, we are recognizing people are taking things up, which means that they are seeing… they're seeing holes to be filled and imagining.

172

00:21:24\.730 \-\-\> 00:21:25\.070

Christine Tridente: Right.

173

00:21:25\.070 \-\-\> 00:21:35\.450

Chad Dorsey: things to fill them, and, you know, that therefore we also get the useful problem of having to grapple with the fact that we didn't have to charge them because nobody understood what they were.

174

00:21:35\.450 \-\-\> 00:21:37\.380

Christine Tridente: Yes, yes, right.

175

00:21:37\.380 \-\-\> 00:21:37\.870

Chad Dorsey: That's great.

176

00:21:37\.870 \-\-\> 00:21:38\.699

Christine Tridente: It's sorted.

177

00:21:38\.700 \-\-\> 00:21:46\.230

Chad Dorsey: Right? Now it's a new conversation. Now people are ready that we were trying to explain to them, and they didn't understand 10 years ago, so…

178

00:21:46\.230 \-\-\> 00:21:48\.530

Christine Tridente: Yes, oh, yes, we can relate to that for sure.

179

00:21:48\.530 \-\-\> 00:21:49\.600

Jennifer Hodges: Sure, absolutely.

180

00:21:49\.600 \-\-\> 00:21:50\.440

Christine Tridente: No doubt.

181

00:21:50\.860 \-\-\> 00:21:55\.930

Christine Tridente: Yes, you'll understand what we do as soon as you need us, and then suddenly, oh, that's it.

182

00:21:55\.930 \-\-\> 00:22:14\.680

Chad Dorsey: Exactly, yep. Yep. Yeah, so that all makes sense. Yeah, so I think, you know, that's the, you know, the sort of interesting, you know, potential sort of layer of overlap. We're in a place where, you know, we're trying to figure out

183

00:22:14\.920 \-\-\> 00:22:16\.620

Chad Dorsey: how the…

184

00:22:17\.100 \-\-\> 00:22:29\.220

Chad Dorsey: Mostly the assets, and somewhat the content, but the content is always interlinked with the assets. Sure. Is, you know, has value for others, and in what ways

185

00:22:29\.430 \-\-\> 00:22:49\.120

Chad Dorsey: You know, if at all those specific assets and content might be valuable, and or, you know, the expertise and the reuse, re\-coordination of those in that latter part we've seen be more valuable, because obviously people have their own ideas, and we can help you realize them.

186

00:22:49\.120 \-\-\> 00:22:49\.580

Christine Tridente: Hmm.

187

00:22:49\.580 \-\-\> 00:23:01\.179

Chad Dorsey: But it may be that there are cases where the things themselves, the tools, are, you know, versatile and valuable within themselves enough that there's a space in the world for them.

188

00:23:01\.180 \-\-\> 00:23:22\.359

Chad Dorsey: But, yeah, I mean, it's mostly been opportunistic up until, you know, or at least more recently. We've done some, you know, years ago, did some more active seeking out of people to say, hey, we've got these things, are you… what are you working on? We've sort of had less bandwidth for a while, but we're trying to sort of bend back to the world where we're actively seeking things out and expanding

189

00:23:22\.360 \-\-\> 00:23:24\.749

Chad Dorsey: The sort of base of what we might…

190

00:23:24\.950 \-\-\> 00:23:29\.800

Chad Dorsey: be offering to the world, whether it's services, products, or beyond, so…

191

00:23:30\.330 \-\-\> 00:23:33\.980

Chad Dorsey: Interesting to hear, sort of, how this is… and I… my guess is…

192

00:23:34\.130 \-\-\> 00:23:47\.099

Chad Dorsey: people know you and call you when they need you. Like you're saying, for the most part, you're sort of known entities by this point, and you've got a group of folks who knows when they're in the right bind to pick up the phone for… Exactly.

193

00:23:47\.340 \-\-\> 00:23:52\.530

Christine Tridente: Yes, yes. But we are always looking to expand that list, but yes, we've been…

194

00:23:53\.060 \-\-\> 00:23:56\.050

Christine Tridente: Pretty lucky with… with that, yeah.

195

00:23:56\.200 \-\-\> 00:23:56\.770

Chad Dorsey: Yeah.

196

00:23:57\.140 \-\-\> 00:24:03\.149

Chad Dorsey: Yeah, so I think that's interesting. You know, I mean, it could be that there's some…

197

00:24:03\.650 \-\-\> 00:24:15\.199

Chad Dorsey: I think… I think that… that in many ways, the work that we're doing is parallel. It could be that there are places where we sort of recognize that

198

00:24:15\.410 \-\-\> 00:24:18\.940

Chad Dorsey: There's value in that parallelism, too, in that, you know.

199

00:24:19\.060 \-\-\> 00:24:37\.890

Chad Dorsey: we're not going to eat your lunch because we're not doing your work, but… and if you, you know, were suggesting somebody who's great at doing X or Y or Z that's different than you, then it might be a bigger, you know, value add to whoever it is, or what have you, so there might be some kind of…

200

00:24:38\.090 \-\-\> 00:24:47\.839

Chad Dorsey: contact connection opportunity sharing to be had within that, or beyond. And more than that, I don't necessarily know, but, like I said, I think there's a…

201

00:24:47\.950 \-\-\> 00:25:02\.129

Chad Dorsey: Well, we would hope for a world, and this is part of why we do this as a nonprofit, you know, we're sort of making these things with, you know, federal funding that, you know, couldn't be made otherwise, we hope continues to be the case.

202

00:25:02\.350 \-\-\> 00:25:04\.450

Chad Dorsey: Doing that in a way that sort of

203

00:25:04\.560 \-\-\> 00:25:15\.209

Chad Dorsey: sets the bar there for folks to go, this is what's possible, like, you can do these things. And when we work with publishers, our intent has been

204

00:25:15\.210 \-\-\> 00:25:23\.839

Chad Dorsey: To raise the bar for them, their expectations internally as well, to say, you know, you don't have to make that an animation, like, you could actually

205

00:25:23\.840 \-\-\> 00:25:47\.909

Chad Dorsey: make it something that was an explorative, interactive thing, you know, authentic simulation, and then you can ask a whole other range of questions around it, or you can use it three times, or what have you. And so, we have seen people slowly, you know, come to realization about that, but, you know, our goal would be to see that happen much more, so that it's much more obvious, you know, part of the assumed fabric of

206

00:25:48\.060 \-\-\> 00:25:59\.199

Chad Dorsey: what people are doing, and that would happen by, you know, sort of opportunistic fits and starts, most likely, but the more opportunities, the better, probably.

207

00:26:00\.070 \-\-\> 00:26:02\.059

Jennifer Hodges: Yep, and there's growth and some learning there.

208

00:26:02\.060 \-\-\> 00:26:02\.910

Chad Dorsey: Right, exactly.

209

00:26:02\.910 \-\-\> 00:26:04\.139

Jennifer Hodges: Makes a lot of sense, yeah.

210

00:26:04\.960 \-\-\> 00:26:11\.800

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, that's really interesting, because your stuff is really beautiful, and I can see it slotting into a lot of different products, but we don't get involved usually that far up the… Right.

211

00:26:11\.800 \-\-\> 00:26:16\.509

Chad Dorsey: Exactly, yeah. So it might be that this is sort of an FYI that.

212

00:26:16\.510 \-\-\> 00:26:16\.900

Jennifer Hodges: Oh my goodness.

213

00:26:16\.900 \-\-\> 00:26:17\.679

Chad Dorsey: And we're sort of…

214

00:26:17\.680 \-\-\> 00:26:18\.980

Jennifer Hodges: Right, absolutely.

215

00:26:18\.980 \-\-\> 00:26:36\.500

Chad Dorsey: on, but in different corners, but, but we may, you know, there may be opportunity to say, oh, okay, well, next time around, hey, there's this, you know, this set of things. You could have thought about it in this way, for that next round you don't want to hear about right now, but, you know, for the next project, for the next something.

216

00:26:36\.500 \-\-\> 00:26:37\.650

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, keep that in mind.

217

00:26:37\.650 \-\-\> 00:26:46\.549

Chad Dorsey: Yeah, or vice versa, if you, you know, realize that Group X is, you know, sort of on the verge of doing a thing, and they're probably not.

218

00:26:46\.910 \-\-\> 00:27:03\.189

Chad Dorsey: until it's already mostly baked, but, you know, all of them right now might be really useful. That's what we… we find that with our work, there tend to be a couple windows that are useful. There's sort of the early window

219

00:27:03\.310 \-\-\> 00:27:13\.880

Chad Dorsey: If you don't know what's possible, then you don't dream broadly enough to sort of imagine it in the framework of what you're creating. And then, once you've…

220

00:27:14\.070 \-\-\> 00:27:37\.470

Chad Dorsey: sort of settled on learning goals, but you haven't focused in on sort of how you're going to get to them pedagogically, then there's another window of saying, well, actually, you could just do it that way, or you could use this tool, this opportunity, or this experience that gives you a grounding for students, and so those two tend to be in the sort of first third of the development stage.

221

00:27:38\.110 \-\-\> 00:27:45\.710

Chad Dorsey: And they tend to be short enough that they're hard to sniff out, and so it's easy to get to somebody who's like, yeah, yeah, but we've already planned out our whole unit, and we're like.

222

00:27:45\.710 \-\-\> 00:27:46\.760

Christine Tridente: Right, right.

223

00:27:46\.760 \-\-\> 00:27:50\.249

Chad Dorsey: So, figuring out how to get in to the conversation.

224

00:27:50\.250 \-\-\> 00:27:50\.820

Jennifer Hodges: Yeah, that level.

225

00:27:50\.820 \-\-\> 00:27:55\.800

Chad Dorsey: the right stage in a way that you can just be like, yeah, yeah, but look at this, too.

226

00:27:55\.800 \-\-\> 00:27:58\.559

Christine Tridente: And they're like, oh… Absolutely.

227

00:27:58\.560 \-\-\> 00:28:00\.430

Chad Dorsey: Absolutely. I'm thinking that correctly.

228

00:28:00\.430 \-\-\> 00:28:08\.869

Jennifer Hodges: curriculum we helped develop and envision from the beginning, Christine, they were like, we're not going to have money for a lot of tools or simulator, and I'm thinking that would have been so great to say to them, you could have one per unit, you know?

229

00:28:08\.870 \-\-\> 00:28:09\.699

Chad Dorsey: Right, exactly.

230

00:28:09\.700 \-\-\> 00:28:17\.700

Jennifer Hodges: you know, they're expensive, they take time to develop, and somebody's got to envision them, and if they exist and you can start with that, I think that's a great place to be. So, yeah, I definitely…

231

00:28:17\.700 \-\-\> 00:28:27\.649

Chad Dorsey: So, that may be the best, you know, mode here, is just to say, okay, great, we know who you are, you know who we are. Right. Take a little bit deeper look at each other's websites and the like.

232

00:28:27\.650 \-\-\> 00:28:44\.759

Chad Dorsey: And then, you know, as we sort of stumble into some different, you know, situations on either side, you know, we can start another call, or we can, you know, commend somebody to each other. Or, like I said, we'll find out a little bit more as we're going along the next 6 or 9 months as we're.

233

00:28:44\.760 \-\-\> 00:28:45\.190

Christine Tridente: investigators.

234

00:28:45\.190 \-\-\> 00:28:54\.589

Chad Dorsey: opportunities, and I think that'll give us a better framework to talk again, too. But this is really great, and I'm so glad to know that you're right there, right down by where I grocery shop. That's very cool.

235

00:28:54\.590 \-\-\> 00:28:56\.189

Jennifer Hodges: Oh, likewise, likewise.

236

00:28:56\.190 \-\-\> 00:29:03\.030

Christine Tridente: Yes, and so anytime, you know, if you want to get together, you know, in person, we're always happy to do that. It's very convenient in this case, so…

237

00:29:03\.030 \-\-\> 00:29:03\.830

Jennifer Hodges: That's wonderful.

238

00:29:03\.830 \-\-\> 00:29:05\.320

Christine Tridente: Yeah, just let us know.

239

00:29:05\.320 \-\-\> 00:29:11\.210

Chad Dorsey: Excellent, well, so great to talk to you and to learn more, and we'll look forward to connecting again when it makes sense.

240

00:29:11\.430 \-\-\> 00:29:12\.410

Christine Tridente: Sounds good.

241

00:29:13\.180 \-\-\> 00:29:13\.660

Jennifer Hodges: Cheer today, Chad.

242

00:29:13\.660 \-\-\> 00:29:14\.830

Christine Tridente: You too. Bye. Bye.

243

00:29:14\.830 \-\-\> 00:29:15\.440

Jennifer Hodges: Bye, guys.
