Transcript:

Them: Good. Nice to see you. How are you?

Me: As well. Great.

Them: Yeah. Thanks so much for meeting with me. Thank you.

Me: The snow of course, I was pleased to get your note and

Them: Bye.

Me: I'm jealous to hear about your plans Montreal. What's the concreteness and timeline and everything around that?

Them: Yeah. So we're still figuring it out. So my my mom is Canadian. I'm a

Me: Okay.

Them: I also have dual citizenship. She is in the process of moving from Providence right now. So

Me: Oh, okay.

Them: she just had an open house this last weekend and just sort of yeah, figuring things out. So I'm kinda focused on getting her there first.

Me: Uh\-huh. Right. Okay.

Them: And then Robert and I are we have some we're we've reached out to some immigration lawyers because he's not Canadian, so we kinda have to figure out, like,

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: I have to go through a process of sponsoring him,

Me: Mhmm. Uh\-huh.

Them: And, yeah, we just have to figure out, like, can he you know, he works remotely. Can he work

Me: Okay. Oh, right. Yep. Exactly.

Them: while he's there? That kind of stuff. Yeah. So we're not exactly sure what our timeline is. We're kind of, like, sometime in the next three to six months, probably, we're gonna be making the shift. But

Me: And I

Them: just yeah. We're taking baby steps right now.

Me: that's very cool and exciting.

Them: It is exciting. Yeah. We we've we have a lot of close friends there, and we've spent a know, we've gone and visited a number of times over the years. And every time we've been, we have just been like, this is such a beautiful city, and

Me: Yeah.

Them: yeah. It's just I've I think also with everything going on

Me: Of course. Of course. Yep.

Them: right now, you know, I'm like, why not go just

Me: Mhmm.

Them: try it out, wait it out for a little bit?

Me: Mhmm. No. That makes total sense.

Them: How things go? And it does seem like there's actually quite a bit

Me: Uh\-huh. Oh,

Them: of tech stuff going on there, especially

Me: really?

Them: actually in like, there's there's, like, a part of the city that's kind of, like, called, like, the AI hub

Me: Oh, interesting.

Them: So I'm kind of interested to see what that is all about. But

Me: Definitely. That's very cool. I wasn't I wasn't aware. Mean, I thought Toronto was sort of in that mode, but I didn't I didn't really know about Montreal one way or another. So

Them: Yeah. I think it might be because, like, I'm I'm I'm curious if

Me: Oh,

Them: it's because real estate's a lot cheaper in Montreal. Like, if there might just be more of have been more like, a startup culture there or something.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I'm not quite sure what it is, but yeah, I'm I'm curious to to learn more about it.

Me: That's awesome.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. But I just yeah. I was curious to meet with you and kind of just get a sense from I guess, just a couple things. Like, I've

Me: Sir,

Them: kind of been thinking about moving into, like, freelance and contract work.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because I have a lot of different projects and types of stuff that I like to do.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: So I'm kind of trying to figure out, like, oh, how can I have a balance of different things And so I was, yeah, I was curious if, you know, you had any advice or insight into moving into that direction? If if

Me: That's a good question.

Them: and then and then also, I was just curious. Yeah.

Me: May maybe is the answer. We'll see. But yeah. And also, yes?

Them: And then oh, yeah. And also, I was just curious to talk with you in general about kind of, like, where you see the future of software engineering going and especially in, you know, in and kind of, like, civically minded or like, kind of more yeah. That kind of world of technology. But just in general, you know, like, I've learned so much about AI and using AI through being at Concord for the last two years and that be really becoming a part of, like, our

Me: Mhmm.

Them: work toolbox that we had.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I'm I'm yeah. I know that you, you know, really keep up up to date on what's going on in AI in particular. And, yeah,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: curious to hear from you about know, what you would recommend to somebody kind of

Me: Right.

Them: I'm I'm, like, four years into my career now as a software engineer. Recommend, you know, keeping an eye out for learning or picking up now that I'm at this

Me: Yeah. It's a those are great questions, and I, you know, feel

Them: point. Yeah.

Me: only qualified to answer them at all, but I'm happy to to, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: about it together. You know, I think it's, you know, I think it's it's a interesting time in all ways of all forms of the phrase. I mean,

Them: Yeah.

Me: Chinese and and otherwise.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Know, I think on the positive side of things, I think if you're sort of

Them: Yeah.

Me: savvy, flexible, you know, know enough tech sort of layers of things that you're not afraid to dig in,

Them: Yeah.

Me: think that there are

Them: Yeah.

Me: areas to succeed in. And there'll be unexpected

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, every day, week, month as we go along too.

Them: Yeah.

Me: You know, I think the I I don't know what you've gotten from the field

Them: Right.

Me: and it's hard to know what's rumored and what's not. You know, that sort of

Them: Right.

Me: standard junior engineer job seems like it not necessarily a growth area right now, but I don't know what

Them: Yeah.

Me: people are gonna do when they realize that you can't just, you know, leap to, you know, expert in things, in the field

Them: Right. Right.

Me: like, has to people have to get experience somehow. Right? So not quite sure what that's gonna mean. I think it's pretty clear that there's still a as usual with these sorts of things, there's still a wide open area for people who are technical and not scared to read the manual on stuff.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And as I am sort of

Them: Mhmm.

Me: you know I mean, I

Them: Mhmm.

Me: kinda equip myself in that mode. Like, if I had time, I'd sort of could be the equivalent of a a, you know, low level engineer, but I don't. So I just sort of read things and make do.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Me: But even with that, there are lots of times where people are doing interesting things with tools or workflows or what have you.

Them: Right.

Me: That it feels like are still like like that person posting that forum

Them: Right.

Me: doesn't really know what they're talking about. And there and there aren't a lot of people on this forum who do know what they're talking about, and and the people who really know what they're talking about are kind of ignoring this all in a way that's

Them: Yeah.

Me: seems kind of silly because

Them: Yeah.

Me: I mean, it might not be exactly what we're saying, but it's not it's not nothing. Right? There's stuff happening here, folks.

Them: Right. Yeah.

Me: And so finding that sort of soft underbelly and

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: places where it intersects, I think, are, you know, opportunities to dig in I mean, it might be this is all completely spitballing. I mean, it might be that there are sort of low risk opportunities in the freelancing space where what you're doing is, you know, doesn't involve creating whole new software framework

Them: Right.

Me: that need to be highly robust, or what have you from scratch.

Them: Right. Yeah.

Me: But our technical enough that they give you experience with tools and, opportunities and

Them: Yeah.

Me: still cool enough. I mean, there's gonna be a window for a while where

Them: Right.

Me: there was in the early web development days, back when when

Them: Yeah.

Me: like, anybody who knew how to spell HTML was, like, five layers ahead of anybody else

Them: Right.

Me: I'm like, oh my god. You made a web page and, like, yeah, I'm not afraid of brackets. Right? It's actually not that

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that hard, actually.

Me: but it seems like magic to people. And there's this whole sort of

Them: Yeah.

Me: series of things, whether it's sort of vibe ish coding stuff on the one side

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: or tools, workflows, other kinds of things on the other side. And things in between where you can go you can go a long ways with stuff. I mean,

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: examples of things I'm playing with, you know, mean, I've finally sort of tipped into realizing the power of n eight n recently, which is sort of low code, no code, but also very you know, technically compatible. Sort of environment for creating workflows of tool and things. And it's, you know, friendly for AI and agent workflows and other kinds of things, but it's very

Them: Yeah.

Me: you wanna take this and then move it to this state and move it through this something and then create some custom

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: hooks that call in other kinds of things. It's like, in twenty minutes, you can get more done than you would have in two days sometimes.

Them: That's amazing.

Me: And it's really it's powerful in ways that

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, people are are intrigued by in general.

Them: Yeah. I feel really interested in that because I feel like I have a lot of experience you know, with, like, Cursor or ChatGPT or with

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Copilot, but, like, kind of, like, one off interactions or, like, contained interactions with one. Kind of instance of an LLM agent versus I'm I've been really I've been reading a little bit more about

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that and interested more in, like, those kinds of

Me: Mhmm.

Them: tools that are, like, actually connecting a lot of different types of tools together.

Me: Yeah. And, I mean, the interesting I think one of the things with it I mean, it's it's sort of a it's hard to tell whether it's just for cobbling things together or know, a little bit more technical more sort of robust than that. It's it definitely is all I mean, it's

Them: Mhmm.

Me: solid on the underneath side and everything is j everything sort of outputs in JSON. It's not

Them: Yeah.

Me: trying to hit and you can self host and you I mean, so it's it's a it's a fairly robust architecture too.

Them: Yeah.

Me: But that said, like, if you want to explore sort of ideas about multi agent setups or something like that.

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: You can do it in, like, ten minutes. You just pull down the tool

Them: Yeah.

Me: and y and z and then pull down this one for chat and this one for telegram

Them: Yeah.

Me: one for something. All of a sudden, you've got a a system running, and it's a really low effort way to sort of explore this notion of

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: sort of some of the structures people are using in in AI.

Them: Yeah. That's really interesting.

Me: On the other side, there's I mean, there's just no end of

Them: Right.

Me: stuff out there that are frameworks, but also pretty reasonable places to step in on them. You know, it's just

Them: Yeah.

Me: playing with Haystack in the background as a sort of full kind of stack rag implementation that seems like it's

Them: Okay.

Me: it can be, like, pretty off the shelf in terms of just, like, check this out and go. And so

Them: Right.

Me: you know, if you know how to run Docker, if you know how to sort of ask the questions, if you know what acronyms you're looking for,

Them: Yeah.

Me: there's opportunity to sort of go, oh, I sort of see how that goes, and maybe I could add another piece into it. And it feels like

Them: Right.

Me: now is the time when, you know, you're not gonna be selling snake oil because you're doing

Them: Yeah.

Me: interesting stuff. But, you know, anybody who's like, oh, yeah. I'd like

Them: Right.

Me: to add AI to my business. Know?

Them: Right.

Me: Probably you could do more on a weekend than they could imagine in a year because they aren't thinking about it in that particular way.

Them: Right.

Me: But, you know, that flower shop just got its orders processed better. In a way that's you know, is it amazing? Is it, like,

Them: Right.

Me: safe for men in the middle of text? Probably not. But it's all, like,

Them: Yeah.

Me: underneath a surface for them or something. I don't know. You know? I I mean, I could imagine

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: that you might be able to do that. And I

Them: Yeah.

Me: for me, it's mostly speaking from my own experience, but it's, you know, for me, it's always useful to have something that's a tangible project of the right sort of grain size with some kind of accountability on it.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So that's why I say the freelancing thing in a way that might be casual or ad hoc.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: But might give you a chance to say, oh, okay.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: How how do I put real user needs in the middle here in some way?

Them: Right.

Me: So that I at least I don't let myself off the hook when that thing doesn't work. And, you know, I don't learn how to, you know, finish it all off or or what have you.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So there's there's lots of stuff in that space there. Let's see. The kinds of things I mean, so all kinds of models. It seems like that's

Them: Yeah.

Me: commodity at this point. I mean, it kinda doesn't matter mostly. I think the I think understanding some of the things that people are doing with agents.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Understanding some of the things people are doing with and getting fluent with like, a stack that's repurposable for some of these

Them: Okay.

Me: solid layers like

Them: Mhmm.

Me: new rag and then knowing how to build

Them: Mhmm.

Me: other kinds of tools into it. Haystack seems interesting because it has these pipelines that you can sort of add in lots of other kinds of tools really easily. So you can sort

Them: Right.

Me: say, okay. Add this into my stack and you don't have to do a lot of reprogramming.

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: You can vibe code those kinds of tools

Them: That's really interesting.

Me: too. So

Them: Yeah.

Me: something like that where you're sort of saying here's a solid thing,

Them: Yeah.

Me: and might be a way to get feet wet

Them: Yeah.

Me: But, yeah, I I don't know. I I know well, I know more more than that.

Them: No. That's great. That's that's great to learn about

Me: What I speak.

Them: So the heat stack and n eight n are the two

Me: I think there are two things that I've been playing with recently that are interesting

Them: yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna look into

Me: You know, I think that, you know, people so in terms of, you know, coding tools, cursor is, you know, one thing that that's

Them: Right.

Me: I think, still staying powerful. People are, you know, there's a whole there's a pretty equal camp that is Gaga over clogged code, which I should

Them: Mhmm.

Me: do more with. That's that's essentially the the terminal version of these things, but apparently, it's really powerful for for that

Them: Right. Right.

Me: especially if you, you know, live in terminal more.

Them: Yeah.

Me: And is there more somebody just posted that codex OpenAI codex just amazed them The the kinds of things that are feel like they're bubbling in those spaces are people pulling up multi agent swarms to tackle their coding problems.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So, like, okay. Here's a bunch of bugs. You know? They're just

Them: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Me: spun up 20 different things to try to run those through or this one's doing testing or what have you.

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: And that seems like the the thing of the of the instant right now. But would be a good excuse to learn.

Them: Right. That's what I was particularly interested in. I think you shared an article or someone was talking about, like, how their yeah. Just, how their coding environment kind of became turbocharged once they started using these multi agent workflows to real

Me: Right.

Them: like, tackle problems and be like, okay. I basically set it up. I tell it what I need it to do. I walk away. I come back twenty minutes later. I kinda check on what it's generated so far, and then I

Me: Mhmm.

Them: go from there.

Me: Yeah. And there's lots of that that seems to be bubbling right now. And

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, I think you get into the place of being able to be. And you know, projects like we're talking about might be opportunities for you to figure out how to be I mean, essentially, the skills that need to be honed most are you know, I think, still. You know, architect, like engineer delegator kind of thing, it's

Them: Right.

Me: where you're able to sort of understand the problem space and say, oh, that needs to be tackled. And

Them: Right.

Me: step in when the loop is going nowhere, and do some stuff yourself.

Them: Yes. Yeah.

Me: But but also we

Them: Right.

Me: kind of watching the overall and planning the architecture, watching it, moving it forward, making sure that it doesn't sort of, you know, scope creep in some way.

Them: Yeah.

Me: And, you know, those kinds of skills are useful regardless. But

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: especially useful if you can do it with an army of

Them: Yeah. It's

Me: 20 bots that are running off for you.

Them: interesting. It seems like the engineering role is more moving into, like, the architecture role, like, really engineers becoming architects and orchestrating these different agents who are the engineers engineers.

Me: I think certainly that's gonna be a big part of it. Yeah.

Them: Yeah. I was also

Me: Yeah.

Them: curious. Do you feel like in educational technology or just, like, kind of in yeah. Are there are there or civic other kind of, like, civically minded organizations. Are there organizations that you're looking at who you feel like are doing work that feels exciting or that feels like kind of they're in integrating AI or just other or other processes or other

Me: Yeah.

Them: aspects of technology that you feel excited about.

Me: Yeah. That's a good question. I mean, I think there are not too many groups in the education space who are

Them: Yeah.

Me: being mean, everybody's being inventive, but they're doing it at different levels and lots

Them: Right.

Me: of it is on the sort of API wrapper level still.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Probably will be

Them: Right.

Me: And I should be more versed in who's doing things at this higher level that we're kind of talking in or or above.

Them: Right.

Me: You know, one one group I need to get back in touch with again is PlayLab. .Ai. There, he's thinking probably best of most of the people I've talked to about sort of longer term version visions of how teachers can work with AI to improve the things that they're doing and the

Them: Mhmm.

Me: classroom and, you know, lessons and what have you.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: But but, yeah, I haven't necessarily found, you know, a group of five or six you know, amazing companies that are doing amazing, surprising things yet. But

Them: Right. Right. Yeah.

Me: maybe just for lack of

Them: Time and yeah.

Me: you know, my ability to see it since this is all moving so quickly.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. I know my my mother\-in\-law was telling me about she had watched, like, a sixty minutes program on, like, Con Amigo or Con Amigo, which is

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Khan Academy kind of, like, personalized AI tutor. She was really excited about that because she was a special education teacher for, like, forty years. And thinks a lot about, like, personalized instruction.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That was and I know, you know, we were we've been starting to do that with Clue and AI, and that's kind of

Me: Yeah.

Them: I was last working on while

Me: Yeah. I mean, I think I think the frontiers

Them: yeah.

Me: in education for the moment and that lasts for, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: as long as any other cycle of it, you know, half hour or whatever. But, but I think think people aren't so that sort of customized, you know, chatbot, in ways that hopefully are informed and and fine tuned by pedagogical practice practices. But I think there's

Them: Mhmm.

Me: not much of that at all, partially because we not just partially, largely because we don't have the data to sort of inform that kind of that that model. But that's

Them: Yep.

Me: that's one big, you know, frontier area is informing models with real data about pedagogical practices and learning because they're just not useful otherwise. That all wraps into having some kind of a good retrieval or rag model or something which

Them: Right. Right.

Me: that with a, you know, asterisk because probably gonna evolve significantly over the next year or

Them: Yeah.

Me: as well too. What is the right is it right? Is it something else?

Them: Yeah.

Me: But that notion of being able to and I think the bigger is what I'm playing with a little bit myself, trying to make tools that are sort of personally helpful in the background. Memory is the big thing that is missing right now.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And if there's an area in AI world that is sort of vitally necessary and waiting to be tackled, think it's that And for education, think it's, you know, key. Obviously student data is gonna be a issue with it, but

Them: Right.

Me: with that,

Them: Right.

Me: I mean, you can't get anywhere without having sort of persistent memory about

Them: Yes.

Me: you, stateful agents. So that

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: the other thing I was I've been playing with this last few days is the one the one place that seems to be rising up in that space is called Letta, l e t t a. Which is a sort of background framework for sort of multileveled stateful memory. And it it also has the kind of things when I was imagining this, of weeks ago, and I was I was thinking, yeah. Finally, you need to take these things, but you also need medium term within

Them: Right.

Me: some of these are core memories about identity that aren't gonna change. And then

Them: Yeah.

Me: what we need do is really cycle every so often sort of a heartbeat to process and move things and kinda like your brain does. Okay. That's

Them: Yeah. Right.

Me: forget most of the stuff. But

Them: Right.

Me: one's so important that it's not just like

Them: Yes.

Me: return. Now this is medium term, whether it's a project or it's

Them: Yeah.

Me: now embroidery or whatever it is.

Them: Yeah.

Me: And,

Them: Right.

Me: it has some of those cycles built in of sort of sleep cycles that sort of go through and

Them: Yeah.

Me: process and cycle things into different layers and brain. And

Them: Oh, that's so interesting. Yeah. Yeah.

Me: that I think is gonna be the thing that I'm surprised

Them: Yeah.

Me: we I'm surprised there's not much infrastructure for it right now. I'm surprised it's hard to find things on it. And it's kind of overlooked.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Maybe people are just too excited about the the momentary, but you're not gonna get far without that. And the things that are really looking far ahead and

Them: Yeah. Right.

Me: some glasses on order and other kinds of and those people are excited too about it's about memory. Like, what did I do last year? Who is this person? What are they like? You know, what am I into right now?

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: What do I need? Over Friday? You know, those kinds of things.

Them: Yeah. That's really that's really fascinating because, yeah, I've I've, you know, thought about that on, like, a smaller very much smaller scale of, like, working on Devi or something and thinking about stateful agents where and thinking about employing multi agents where you have, like, one agent who's kind of like, okay. Every so often, it's just summarizing the conversation that's happened so far, and then that just becomes the history of what's happened and only the salient stuff is remembered. But I think, yeah, thinking about that, like, on a long term, bigger scale is really fascinating.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Yeah. And I'm surprised I have not seen as much yet. Maybe I've just been missing about in learning. And, you know, and student data is that the, you know, complication, of course, but but, like, that's what learning is. Right? And so and I can't imagine that

Them: Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Me: know, anything is gonna make any progress without starting to make student models that, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: move forward. So

Them: Yeah. Okay. Cool. That's good to know. So Leta I'm gonna look into for sure, and then I have these other

Me: Yep.

Them: yeah, other things to look into as well. That's awesome. Thank

Me: Yeah. No. I think all those are are interesting rabbit holes

Them: Yeah.

Me: that will take you somewhere, and they all have a little less so, but it does have a Discord community. But, you know, decent sort of communities of people and and forums and things around them. You can get started with, you know, not just staring at the wall. So Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. Well, yeah, I know I don't wanna take up too of your

Me: Yeah. Well, the

Them: but that that's really helpful.

Me: is hopefully helpful a little bit. I mean, it's interesting for me to sort of play it out and and

Them: It is. It really is helpful.
