Transcript:

Them: Hey,

Me: Yes.

Them: Have you ever had mice in the middle of summer?

Me: No. We've never had mice at all. We have

Them: We've only had them in the fall.

Me: carpenter bees and other kinds of things. But not rodents. Outside of

Them: Have gotten mice

Me: groundhogs.

Them: before. Our like, our lawnmower and those tools are kept in a garage that's under our back porch. Our back porch is attached to our family room and garage. It was an addition put on at a later date. And we've seen you know, evidence that the that I think it's called the sill plate where the

Me: Right.

Them: the porch connects. It you and then

Me: Mhmm.

Them: made a porch out of it in that connection. We've seen evidence where the there are some crevices to get from that porch area. And when we first moved here, I we I had a Siberian house creek years ago, and he actually caught one in the family room for me.

Me: Well,

Them: And it's a very old style radiator that's, like,

Me: Oh,

Them: in and it's a concrete floor with tile. It's very bizarre. It's

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: one room we've never done anything with. But that's the only place where we've ever seen Mouse. Mice rather.

Me: Oh,

Them: But I noticed one in my baking drawer yesterday or the day before. I was like, And, you know, I probably haven't cleaned it often enough, and, of course, it didn't come into baking this summer. And so I cleaned it all out, and Kevin put out a trap. But it's not they're not coming in the way they used to. Because he put it down there, and I found evidence again today, and I'm just so frustrated. I'm like, like, I was just downstairs with my flashlight looking like, where are there crevices in these cabinets?

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: And you know, sometimes in a house, if you don't build it yourself, there's things that are done

Me: Right.

Them: you just like, I don't understand why they did that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So I'm like, where is it coming from? Is it but I guess also, and I don't know if this is throughout Massachusetts, but in Central Mass, there is a lot of infestation of rats.

Me: Wow.

Them: Now

Me: I did not know.

Them: you know, the droppings I saw weren't

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I knew they were mouse droppings, but last spring, we found a

Me: Wow.

Them: a dead rat carcass across the street on our neighbor's lawn when we were walking our dog.

Me: Crazy.

Them: And we've had two people over the summer

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Right.

Them: from pest control services. You know how they're doing things in the neighborhood? They'll call yeah. So two different pest control companies knock on our door saying, oh, we're doing stuff in the neighborhood. We understand that they're there's been a lot of rodents and

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: have you found any? Do you have any interest in our services? That type of thing. And we hadn't seen anything. So I'm very perplexed how, like, it's been

Me: A

Them: hot. But that's it's usually, like, when it's cold, the mice come in.

Me: Right. And it's been hot for a long time. So if it were that, it would have been months ago.

Them: Yeah. So I'm

Me: Feels like. That's really interesting. Yeah.

Them: so I'm I'm in Kevin's with Felicia today for her infusion, I texted him and then

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I'm just what what else do I need to do? I don't wanna keep cleaning the drawer every

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah. That's not maintenance is not the solution here.

Them: day. That's you know, because there's a lot it's where I have all my measuring cups, all the measuring spoons, the spat

Me: Mhmm. Of course. Of course. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: spatulas. It's so

Me: Oh my gosh. That's crazy.

Them: anyway, that's what I've been going through for the last five minutes.

Me: Wow.

Them: Like, I'm problems problem solving about

Me: Yeah. We we've we've got we've got ants. We've got

Them: mice.

Me: carpenter bees. We don't have rodents besides our our woodchuck right now. So which is a different

Them: Do you have anything that I wonder if the fox keeps some of, like,

Me: I don't know. We haven't had Fox for a couple of years,

Them: do you have fewer chipmunks?

Me: so not so much. We've got some, but know, the in the winter, the foxes would get rid of things, but not as much in the summer because they're not around then. And even then, we didn't feel like they kept things down the way we'd expect them. They find rabbits around the neighborhood or whatever. But Mhmm.

Them: Mhmm. I did hear the, on occasion, usually a few times a year, we hear a an owl

Me: Mhmm.

Them: hanging out

Me: Yeah.

Them: And we love when the owl comes because it will

Me: Right.

Them: depress the chipmunk and rabbit population.

Me: Exactly.

Them: Very nice. So

Me: That's great.

Them: anyway, alright. That was my adventure for the day.

Me: Sounds like it's not just for the day, unfortunately, but

Them: Yes. True. But

Me: Right.

Them: you know, I said to Kim, I said, I'm happy to deal with this then. Sort of medical stuff.

Me: Yeah.

Them: It's been.

Me: Alright. Yeah. I'm sure.

Them: She said so much. I'm like, it's kind of

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: nice to just deal with stuff at home.

Me: Can imagine.

Them: So Leslie put a Lucas event

Me: Yeah. Which is fine. I I told her to put me and me on it. Yeah. Because

Them: Oh, you're optional. Okay.

Me: it needs it needs to move forward, and I've just been part of a couple of them. So I'm okay with

Them: Okay.

Me: whenever it happens.

Them: It overlaps with

Me: Yeah. I'm

Them: Judy and Sue. Do you want me to adjust anything next week?

Me: I don't think so. I'm gonna wait to see what happens because Boris also wants to connect one on one at some point later next week, he said. And I've got a message into him to see when what later next week means for him. I am though that Friday and I'm just gonna mail Becca back she asked for an update. And so I'll copy you on that I didn't realize until this weekend that we've got to be up in Maine earlier than, like, that we're going to the family wedding in Maine, and apparently we need to be at the reception at like, five, which means getting the shuttle at four down the long gravel road to or something. So we're hoping to get up there, grab Liam and go. My afternoon stuff probably needs to be rescheduled including hopefully, there's an easy time time with Becca because I won't be able to take that 01:00\. I'll be in the car with relatives. Mhmm.

Them: So move the Sue and the the Becca meeting.

Me: Yeah. The Sue and the Becca. And I'll copy you on the message to Becca because I have to mail her

Them: K. Okay.

Me: some updates today anyway.

Them: Okay. Okay. So you're but you're gonna take some meetings in the morning?

Me: Yeah. The morning is

Them: We have to have our goodbye.

Me: fine. I mean, that morning, I know. We gotta have our goodbye.

Them: I won't talk to you as often.

Me: I know I'm submitting a proposal probably that day as well. So, hopefully, that'll happen first thing in the morning. Because I don't wanna be doing it

Them: Are you doing the submission, or is this Dan?

Me: The pose Dan might be, but I'm doing a bunch of the writing,

Them: Right.

Me: So so that may know, I may be involved you know, Thursday into Friday morning. We'll see. But it needs in my point of view, it needs to be in well, everybody's needs to be in Friday morning because second is the due date, and the first is the holiday. So Mhmm. So that grand scheme may or may not be meaningful, but

Them: Yes. I was gonna say it maybe it needs to be

Me: we'll

Them: a different day or

Me: that's

Them: the following week, I didn't put one on because there was something I took it off because it's a shorter work week, and I think Lisa had some something. I can put it back, obviously.

Me: Yeah.

Them: If

Me: I see.

Them: Oh, I moved it to Thursday. That's what it was. Next week's Grants is on Thursday because I wanted to open up Friday, and I think Lisa had stuff on

Me: Sir,

Them: other days. Taking her mom to an appointment.

Me: that's fine.

Them: Because I was going through

Me: Yeah. And I'll mhmm.

Them: the calendar and updating it to

Me: Oh, that's great.

Them: to get you two days a week where you have one or less meeting based I think I got through to November.

Me: That's great. Yeah. And I'll see we'll see if it makes sense tomorrow or not because I just realized this would be is out this week. So we'll have to make we'll make the call on the fly as to whether Granola scene tomorrow makes sense or not. But but

Them: Okay. If nothing, I'm sure Cynthia will have you have you been

Me: Not not enough.

Them: connecting with Cynthia on The Pose so far? Yeah.

Me: So I can use that time to do that.

Them: Okay. Yeah. Because she'll say, give me ten minutes so you can tell me where you're at.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Exactly. You know, she she she wants the narrative to read, and I don't have one yet. So yeah. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Okay.

Me: So that Friday afternoon, the twenty ninth, is the one thing that came up as a reschedule.

Them: Yep.

Me: You can deal with the Sue one directly, and I'll copy you on backup message

Them: Yep. Okay.

Me: soon.

Them: Alright. What time do you think you have to leave, Juan? Like,

Me: Yeah. I don't think I should take anything afternoon.

Them: oh, Liam's already gonna be in school. Oh, school's starting next week. It hasn't hit me.

Me: Yeah. School starts. Exactly. I know.

Them: Even though I know it, it hasn't hit me.

Me: I know. Yeah. Does yours start next week too next week too? You have weird specials.

Them: Felicia starts next week, but Cora doesn't start till after Labor Day.

Me: Alright. Yeah.

Them: Cora has her last year at Nashopa. Yeah. She's an eighth grader, and it only goes to eighth grade. But

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Oh, yes.

Them: she's headed to Chiwaukee. Have you ever heard of that camp up in Maine?

Me: Yes. Lots of people in Maine would go to that. Mhmm.

Them: So next week,

Me: Oh, nice.

Them: on Tuesday, her class leaves. The whole class goes to Chewonkie for three and a half days.

Me: Oh, awesome. Oh, that's great.

Them: Yeah.

Me: How cool.

Them: She's excited, but she has a lot of classmates or, you know, her crew that she talks to in the summer. They're nervous because they haven't done a lot of

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: you know, but having gone to Camp Hawkins and

Me: Right.

Them: you know, doing a fair amount of hiking. She's like, I can't wait.

Me: That's great.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Have fun. Yeah. So I I should just assume that I'm done at new or off at noon there, and I'll check\-in with Liz about picking Liam up

Them: Okay.

Me: If we have to bump things earlier, we can. But

Them: Okay. Oh, if you have to, we

Me: We're coordinating

Them: say goodbye on Thursday, but

Me: Oh, we could do it early in the morning. Coordinating with relatives. I didn't even realize my in laws are coming in that night before and then staying over, and then we're leaving that day to go to Maine. And so it's like, oh,

Them: So it's a much bigger deal than yeah.

Me: more more crazy than I realized. Well, it's not it's not that big of the other pretty low key, but it's

Them: Right. But in terms of the

Me: just more there's more involved logistics than I'd realized a week and a half We sort of all have been realizing it's like, oh, yeah. And then we need

Them: yes. That's what I meant.

Me: to get closed for Liam and so and it's like, oh, yeah.

Them: Yep. Yep.

Me: Lots of things. But it'll be fine. Mhmm.

Them: I think I'm gonna talk to Sue because you have your normal check\-in. I started moving those from Fridays to Thursday.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Thinking, well, Thursday's the day that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: all hands in C4 happen, So I'll make Thursday a meeting day. So you had Friday more open.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Since you have your normal check\-in, this one on Friday is supposed to be just a financial sort of

Me: Right. Okay.

Them: cash flow. Where we at

Me: Mhmm.

Them: forecasting. She wanted a separate meeting, and I'll see if she wants to lengthen Thursday or

Me: Right. Yeah. We could trigger things around on Thursday and give

Them: maybe I just adjust it and Yeah.

Me: ourselves more time. Yep.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. So I'm gonna I'll talk to her and play around with things. The other thing that I did and you tell me if I'm wrong, I played around with all hand stuff

Me: That's fine. We're we have real we need we'll need to rework that anyway, so it's fine to play around

Them: I sorta

Me: with it. Mhmm.

Them: yeah. And I cut it to sixty minutes because

Me: That's fine. It's never

Them: or maybe

Me: that's fine.

Them: I may have I think I did forty five minutes because I don't think we've been an hour for a number of years.

Me: Yeah. I think almost almost never. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: So you'll see that. And

Me: Yeah.

Them: it's just

Me: No. That's great.

Them: you know, obviously, I was just trying things.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Okay. I still need to I was I started doing the Helen this morning. Okay. I thought it might be useful to do a quick check\-in on

Me: Mhmm.

Them: OmniFocus.

Me: I've been looking through

Them: Because I I don't know how much you've looked at it in the last four to eight hours.

Me: I've been I've been looking through it and just before this as well. So I think it's not bad in terms of being up to date.

Them: Who's monitoring the donation page before

Me: We've got I mean,

Them: Danielle starts.

Me: so it's not really open. It's not open yet.

Them: We'd soon must get notification.

Me: Yeah. Sue and I and, I mean, I get emails. Sue gets emails. Cynthia gets emails.

Them: Okay.

Me: So lots of people do. And And we haven't you know, described it to the world yet even though I think it's available. So or maybe it's not even opened up yet. So there's not been that much of monitor.

Them: If it's operational, one thing that you could do is make sure that the social media links are updated with it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Like, sort of landing pages at LinkedIn and I think Cynthia's been using Facebook a whole lot, but

Me: Yeah. That that's a good point.

Them: just to make sure that make sure that is all coordinated and I mean, Danielle will probably have ideas about this, but you can also take advantage of all the fun days. You know how the calendar is full of days

Me: Alright. Mhmm.

Them: like pancake day and whatever, and you could do you know, look for all those opportunities with STEM and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: science and and you know, code app and that kind of thing. The other thing that they're little.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But it's a way to grow people knowing about what we do is you can do ads on Facebook, and they're very cheap.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So you could and you can target them You can say all teachers all educators, you can tailor it even more. You can do it in a region. Like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: around projects, like, you can set ZIP codes and say, put this in the feed of people, like,

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: around Middle Tennessee you could test that or you can do things like that. It's I used it a lot in education, and I think the stage where Concord is

Me: Right.

Them: you're not going to necessarily get a lot of gifts, but it's exposure to creating it and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: probably around code app. Like, take all your code app users

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that, you know, all the and all the people that had the mailing list and make sure that send them a note and send a message

Me: Mhmm.

Them: follow us. I don't know if anybody's ever done that.

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: But that's one way to make sure that they're seeing notices about

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, exciting things happening at Concord related to growth and that kind of thing project.

Me: Yeah. I I mean, I think we're thinking in different dimensions about exposure and awareness and some ways that we've done and sort of let slide in other ways that we haven't before.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: It'll be nice to have someone who's totally focused on that.

Me: Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. And as I'm looking across, I think

Them: Okay.

Me: you know, most of these are

Them: You didn't hear back from Heidi, did you?

Me: Heidi

Them: Savas?

Me: No. But I haven't I haven't responded either. I still need I need to respond.

Them: I thought you sent a follow\-up.

Me: I didn't send I didn't send a follow\-up to the their response, Andrew, from responded to us.

Them: Oh, okay.

Me: I didn't send a follow\-up to that yet.

Them: Okay. That's what it was.

Me: So I still need to do that.

Them: Because you had sent something to Heidi and then Andrew responded.

Me: Yes. Exactly. And I still need to respond to that one, which is

Them: Yeah. Okay.

Me: probably not on here. Be like, it's in the inbox. Yeah. It's in the inbox. That's why.

Them: Yeah. Okay.

Me: But it needs to be dealt with. I'm very crossed.

Them: Okay.

Me: Yep. Yeah. And that's it. And there's stuff in the inbox. That's critical. Probably not. Just probably clean some of it out.

Them: In some stuff, it's sort of you need a little time to pad. Like, you're gonna have another conversation with Cynthia and Lisa and Sue about rolling out the security piece

Me: Right.

Them: for fall proposals. You've got some reading. I think you should look at adding some kind of time frame for this annual report.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Just just so that it it pops up, and it's

Me: Right.

Them: not her sending you a note every other day during a week when you really can't get to it that week.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. I agree.

Them: I did I did put out on Slack here's what your travel is shaping up to be.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because I wanted to make sure

Me: Mhmm.

Them: people who may not be checking your calendar as frequently. No. And then if, like, there's it's it's clustered, Chad, in in short time frame.

Me: Yeah.

Them: You know, affecting the board, affecting a couple

Me: Yeah. And, of course, clustered yeah. And clustered around

Them: proposals,

Me: other stuff, proposals. Yes. Exactly.

Them: So I think that that's the kind of thing where when all that kind of stuff converges

Me: Mhmm.

Them: without someone saying,

Me: Yeah.

Them: Chad, Chad, Chad, that's when you're more likely to either get ultra focused or

Me: Yeah. I think you're right. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: sort of be, like, there's so much to do. It's almost hard to see what what's what I should

Me: Yeah. I think that's a really good point.

Them: spend my time on. Alright. There's a flag on review first time donor appeal language.

Me: I just bought it and the

Them: As ASAP. You put it in yesterday, so it was is that something you're wanna do before you leave this week?

Me: Which one is yes. I'll I need to do that.

Them: It says review first time donor appeal language

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I need to do that.

Them: ready for final approval.

Me: This week. Yeah. I think the flag things are actually accurate as need to be done. ASAP.

Them: Alright. There's it looks like there's gonna be a strategy discussion on September 2\.

Me: Yes. I need to schedule that.

Them: Isn't that the day that Daniel's starting?

Me: Yes. It may or may not be then, but we're we're talking about that onboarding day on Monday and hope hopefully, I'll

Them: Okay. Okay. So it's

Me: figure out what the right schedule is. I would like look. I mean, I wanna have people around

Them: yep.

Me: Danielle is here. I'd like to have a strategy discussion whether it's too much to put them all together. I haven't really

Them: Okay. Okay.

Me: figured out, but but if we do that, I need to get it on the calendar.

Them: I think and I don't know if the time one of these decide on timing of first donor appeal launch, immediate versus waiting for Danielle. Did did some of that come out of the board call? And the reason I'm asking is one of the things that can happen depending on I don't know who the audience is for that appeal, but parents are inundated right now with you know, having to fill out 10 forms

Me: Right.

Them: per kid for day care and preschool and school and college and all of that stuff. So remember that when you're deciding on your timing.

Me: Right. Yeah. No. I think so. And

Them: And I don't know if everyone on the board thinks about that.

Me: right. Exactly.

Them: If that's where it came from. Like, you need to fundraise now.

Me: No. It did it's more of a just letting people know that we are doing this. It's a very soft sell intro to let

Them: Yep.

Me: people know that we're you know, that they'll be getting you emails from us occasionally that ask for money, and we're not just

Them: Right.

Me: trying to make money off them. We're trying to do lots of things.

Them: Yeah. You have the September 2 strategy meeting calendar thing. On here twice.

Me: Right.

Them: One is add September 2 strategy. The other is set up September strategy meeting.

Me: Yeah.

Them: That tells me it's super important

Me: Tells me it's come up a couple times at least. That's for sure. Yeah.

Them: Yes.

Me: Okay. There.

Them: Okay. Does that Savas letter about licensing does that seems like it should have a flag because I think it came in last week.

Me: Yeah. Came in probably before that, actually.

Them: Maybe attempt you know, try to get it done by tomorrow. Okay.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Is there any update on the conversation with Pam

Me: No. I need to do that. I need to make sure I've mailed her

Them: Okay.

Me: by by tomorrow so that I can let her so that she knows I've already followed up with her.

Them: Okay.

Me: I'll probably do that right after we talk with these folks in Oakland. Then I can use that as a chance to think about what we wanna ask other districts.

Them: Okay. Those are the things that sort of jump out at me

Me: Yeah. I think

Them: in terms of

Me: those are good calls, I think.

Them: like, making sure things that have been sitting there don't sit there

Me: Yeah.

Them: too long and

Me: Yep. I agree.

Them: give you a sense of how to like, think about how you have to prioritize this. Like, the fall blog post Cynthia didn't put any kind of time frame.

Me: Right.

Them: But sometimes, often that can be delayed because other things just by their nature, are a higher priority.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: So sometimes that stuff doesn't go out until mid October, But you know, you're

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you you know, your travel is starting

Me: Right. Yeah. Exactly.

Them: the third week in October. So that's something that you probably wanna try and get done before that.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

Them: And I'm wondering, because of going to either it's not as big a deal if you're only going to DC, but the ADS meeting, advisory board meeting. You then have a VHS board meeting that week.

Me: Yeah. I saw that. Mhmm.

Them: But they don't know. They didn't tell

Me: Mhmm.

Them: tell you when yet. You have AIM Con in Pitts

Me: Yeah. I don't think I'll go into that.

Them: That's what I was thinking.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Like, can I take that off your calendar?

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Because then you'd be gone every you'd have something every week. You've got the Rytel You've got that thing in Gillette. You've got

Me: Yeah.

Them: Minneapolis plus the DRK twelve deadline. And

Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: truthfully, if you can get the annual report blog post

Me: Mhmm.

Them: done, the September the proposal writing and your travel Your travel won't impact your your proposal writing quite as negatively.

Me: Right. Yeah. That's a good point.

Them: And the the other thing, I don't know if there's any hacks for this or apps, but and maybe Omnifocus says something about this, but that idea of you know, some people will put in their

Me: Mhmm.

Them: calendar, you know, this is my time to make phone calls. This is my time to do writing. This is my time to and you may not always adhere to it but

Me: Yeah. I think there are a few things

Them: it if you did something like that,

Me: I think I'm gonna I think I'll have a system that is able to to put some things in front of me to review whether it's email drafts or calendar invites or things like that. And then and I'll need you know, that sort of a half hour to, you know, daily to make sure that I'm doing the processing even even if something's teed up for me by, you know, some auto forwarding or whatever. It's I still need to process it. Mhmm.

Them: Mhmm. Yeah. Okay.

Me: And I need to know, keep things up to date. And Omnifocus so that I can bug myself about them.

Them: One thing that I've noticed is and it could be because you're not deep in proposal development, I feel like you've been trying to keep up to date on Omnifocus and you've tried to I feel like it's been streamlined.

Me: Mhmm.
