Transcript:

Speaker A: From customers. And the intention is to do considerably more of that. In some respects, this exercise is. Is the cart before the horse, the horse being that. That market feedback.

Speaker B: But.

Speaker A: I know we want to move quickly and break things and put it back together and all that kind of thing. So. And I think it'll be. I think it'll. You can tell me at the end, but I think it'll be helpful to have this discussion. This is a tool. This is a methodology. This isn't. The goal here is not to have all our strengths and weaknesses and all that recorded. It's to use that as foundation for making decisions. And they're your decisions. I'm happy to share what I can or draw from my experience, but you guys are deeper into it. Let me see. Before we get into listing the strengths and weaknesses and such, I wanted to ask and perhaps have a conversation setting the stage. What. Excuse me. What would you say is Concord Consortium's North Star the thing that everybody is kind of. Is there a North Star? Is there something that everybody's kind of working toward ultimately, as a. As a goal, more specifically than just existing?

Speaker C: More than just existing. Well, okay, so I'd like to have Concord Consortium here in beyond a year.

Speaker A: Okay, well, that's North Star kinds of. That's not a strategy, though. That's a goal.

Speaker C: You asked for a goal, right?

Speaker A: Well, it is a big goal, but.

Speaker D: In terms of just saying, how do we get.

Speaker E: How do we. Why do we want to be here in a year?

Speaker B: Well, are you asking about the vision? Like, why do we do what we.

Speaker A: Do different from the vision? It's more kind of practical. Where is it we're trying to go and what are we doing currently to get there?

Speaker F: I have an answer to that. Aside from me, me, me, it's all about.

Speaker C: It's all about, you always love me.

Speaker F: I mean, I want to make more scientists. I think that scientists are important, and I think that you can't be a scientist if you don't get interested in science when you're young. I think it's really hard to pick this as a career when you're like 30\. So, you know, I'd like to make that process as appealing and easy and fun and interesting as it possibly could be. That's why I'm here instead of working at Fidelity, for example.

Speaker A: Thoughts on Let me toss out also, I mean, you. I checked before I came in. Spotify considers its North Star the expanding the time people spend listening to music.

Speaker B: Not too far from where.

Speaker A: Facebook is active monthly users.

Speaker C: Money, money Money that's got a.

Speaker E: I.

Speaker A: Pick those two for the contrast to some extent, but it's those kinds of things that are kind of how we're going to get what it is we want to get to.

Speaker D: I think we want to teach children science and make them like it. Like Leslie's saying, make them like it.

Speaker B: The beatings shall continue until morale improves.

Speaker C: Be fun and have them love it.

Speaker D: The more fun stuff that we make that's interactive and not so boring, like the usual they do in the boring school with their boring old crusty teacher who might use technology but can't actually use it because they don't know how.

Speaker A: To turn it on or make it.

Speaker E: Work or teach with it.

Speaker A: So drilling down further, does part of this northstar vision include teachers?

Speaker D: Well, I have a question because you said we're, like, collecting this survey from our customers. First of all, I don't know who that is, because I don't know.

Speaker A: Well, right now it's your mailing list.

Speaker D: Teachers, primarily the people who subscribe to our newsletter.

Speaker G: Is that our customer right now?

Speaker C: I don't know you.

Speaker G: It's like, random.

Speaker E: Yeah, we don't know yet.

Speaker F: Yeah, that's right.

Speaker G: We don't know.

Speaker E: Which is a big app, which we're working on there.

Speaker B: Are you.

Speaker E: There are users. They're users.

Speaker B: Our customer used to be.

Speaker D: We have student users and we have teacher users.

Speaker A: Correct. I'm thinking more about the decision makers, the gatekeepers, not necessarily the people who sign the purchase order, but the people who are deciding what is used. Curriculum, district coordinator, principal, could be. Which is also part of the challenge I see you guys facing is who are we going after? Are they a future administrator? But any other thoughts on North Star here on why do we do what we do? Why do we.

Speaker G: I bet you're gonna say inquiry, sort of.

Speaker B: I mean, I disagree a little bit with Leslie in the sense that my goal in getting into this wasn't necessarily to make more scientists as much as it was to make more students sort of excited and feel confident about themselves and understanding the world around them. So providing tools for them to do that kind of thing, which one might describe as inf.

Speaker G: So, you know, one might describe it as.

Speaker B: I've heard people. Someone said to me, people are saying it's called inquiry. Yeah.

Speaker A: How do you measure that?

Speaker B: How do I measure.

Speaker A: How would one measure everything you just described?

Speaker B: Well, I think you'd measure it as student engagement in the process that they're doing. You would measure it as students being able to apply sort of fundamental Principles to new situations. You would measure it in terms of them actually thinking that science is relevant to their world as opposed to equations or stuff to memorize or vocabulary to memorize.

Speaker A: And do you measure that through assessment? Do you measure that through clicks? Do you measure that through users?

Speaker B: Well, in the research that we do in classrooms, we measure it in various ways we measure it, there's pre post types of assessments to look at, you know, are they able to learning gains, you know, learning gains or are they able to apply this to near and far transfer kind of situations. There's videos and analysis of transcripts and things that are going on in classrooms. There's analysis of what they're doing on screen. Like are they just like you know, doing stuff where they actually seeming like they're exploring and making decisions, informed decisions based on feedback they're getting from what they're doing.

Speaker A: The one thing I latch on to from what you're saying, I heard it all, but what stands out to me is expanding learning gains.

Speaker B: That's not really. I almost don't care so much about what we would call learning gains because that is more like in the. We've achieved such and such standards and da da, da. Like I. One of the things, you know, I used to, I was like, oh, I ended up teaching chemistry and I really liked it because in fact it connected like biology, physics, lots of emergent properties, like stuff that we see around us can all be explained by like some basic ideas. And I like this idea. I like the notion that I can figure stuff out. Like I was the science person of course in the family and everybody's saying, well, how does such and such thing work? And I would like everybody to have like some feeling that they are capable to actually figure things out. Like I, I can, I may not know, but I know like conservation of energy, I know conservation of math. Like there are certain core principles that I can apply to almost anything I'm trying to figure out around me and how it's working. And that gives me confidence that I'm not just like in this. I'm buffeted around in this world that I don't understand and I have no agency. And so for me that's, I want to build people who feel like they have agency, are excited about like what's going on around them, feel like they have power to, you know, make decisions or fix problems or whatever it is because they understand. Yeah, curious minds. I don't want to dull the curious minds that, you know, they start out pretty curious.

Speaker F: Minds.

Speaker B: There we go.

Speaker A: How do you measure. How would one measure progress on those.

Speaker E: Goals?

Speaker C: Students questions, students curiosity, like, that's all could be measured easily. Students engagement also can be measured.

Speaker B: I mean, I used to give, like, a semester project. They could pick anything they wanted. They just had to somehow connect it to chemistry. And I told them I could connect virtually anything that they came up with to chemistry in some way. And, you know, there were, I would say, three quarters of the kids actually picked something that got excited. About a quarter of them picked something off of a. You know, I gave them like three pages of ideas. You can pick one of these, make up your own, whatever. And they were just like, I just want the grade. Just like, give me this thing. And I had some who are like, can I do more than one? You know, that's. That's what you want, right? That's. I. I don't. That's not a real measure, but I don't know how you measure that kind of, like, curiosity or.

Speaker E: I'm interested in people putting people in a novel situation and seeing if they can, you know, get intrigued and tackle it. I mean, my equivalent story to yours is from life is my landlady in Germany, who was the opposite of this when the washing machine didn't work, was stuck, frightened, paranoid, and couldn't do anything for days until she called somebody else, when all you had to do was experiment a little bit and troubleshoot with the machine. But she did not have the agency, the ability, the confidence to something, to realize that you could solve problems in the world. And when we've talked about this in the past, at times, organizationally, we've come to the recognition that STEM is a means to an end in that goal, which is it's a really good training ground for problem solving and critical thinking, way better than a lot of others. And it also happens to be super cool. But it's not necessarily about everybody being a scientist, but it's about not having people stuck like she was.

Speaker B: I do think an outcome would be more scientists.

Speaker E: Yeah, that's. More people would go into it, but.

Speaker B: But it's sort of like a side effect of the main North Star goal.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker F: And I mean, you're raising an interesting question because we tend to do formative things around here. We tend. Not exclusively, but we tend not to do assessments. But helping people understand how to assess this kind of thing is a big deal right now and worth exploring. And the analogy that I have is from my husband's interview process.

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker F: He's an engineer.

Speaker A: You interviewed your husband, too? Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker F: I forgot.

Speaker B: I ran him through the ringer.

Speaker F: You know, he's an engineer, engineering manager. He needs to evaluate in a 45 minute conversation with somebody he's never met before whether or not they're going to be a successful engineer. And he likes to take apart from whatever they happen to be building that day and they can be pretty obscure and put it on the desk and say, tell me what this does. And that is the ultimate inquiry exercise. Because some people go, I don't know and they're like, maybe they'll pick it up and maybe they'll like look for a part number or something. He said, one guy came in and picked it up and dropped it on the floor. And I hired him instantly. Right. Test, test it.

Speaker A: So the common denominator I'm pulling out of all this is problem solving, critical thinking. It ties into I think most of everything that you were saying, curiosity. But you can't solve a problem unless you're curious about it.

Speaker C: So I'd add reasoning, domain based reasoning and it's various domains. But I think that there is habits of mind that are important that we try to embody in the kind of work we do and trying to help learners with this kind of reasoning. And I think that's a big, a big point. It's not did you memorize the right thing? But can you reason? And there's different kinds of reasoning in data science versus geoscience, but there is a domain based reasoning that we're trying to embody and that it connects with the curiosity. If you can get into that reasoning then you can ask interesting questions and you can do the kinds of stuff, stuff.

Speaker B: So I used to include like a magic trick kind of science demo on test, on their test that they hadn't seen at all. And I was like, okay, you get nine out of 10 if you actually apply some reasoning about how you think this magic thing is working. You'll get 10 out of 10 if you get all of it right. But nine out of 10 by just taking all the concepts that we've done this unit and try and apply it to figuring out what's going on here. And these were hard, these weren't things they were going to figure out easily. I didn't expect many people to solve.

Speaker A: Them, but we can move on. I'm still thinking a little bit about how to measure success and what I've broken out as problem solving, critical thinking and domain based reasons.

Speaker D: I think it's voting for people in our democracy that believe in science.

Speaker C: Yes.

Speaker D: Honestly, like in our current Culture. Right. We've there are students really believing that science is a real thing and that they can trust it. And how do you evaluate what scientists are saying to you? Do you believe them? What's evidence? How do you believe certain evidence and not others? How do you reason? And I think that's probably our North Star.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker D: We want to have people who are literate enough in science to be voters. Like school. Right. This public school was made to get people to read so that people could read a newspaper and vote and participate in government. Well now we have science things that are almost more important than just plain reading because no one reads anymore. But that I feel like that is the North Star.

Speaker A: Other thoughts on that?

Speaker E: I agree 100% speaking as a non scientist and that's what attracted me to come to Concord anyway. It's just a better educated voting public.

Speaker C: And it goes with reasoning too.

Speaker D: Yeah, that's what made me think of it.

Speaker H: And that's for me too. That would be my North Star. That's why I've been here.

Speaker A: Science literacy improving, increasing, expanding.

Speaker B: A more important, more informed civic engagement.

Speaker E: Yeah. Yep, I think that's it. And one, one subtlety that we may want to decide is there isn't a Star camp but we have traditionally existed to make an education that does those things. Which is to say like students are the end recipients of it. But our work has really been can we make education better in these ways which has oriented some of our work. We might work with publishers or or other folks to realize that they can amplify this something. We might work with teachers to change their minds because that has an effect for 20 years we have not necessarily said we're going to be the ones selling directly to students. That might be the right thing. It might be very distracting. I don't know.

Speaker A: And this is a good transition to kind of next step that I have in mind is what is. We'll get into the details and strengths but what is CC's concrete's core competency? What are you guys best at?

Speaker F: Writing credits?

Speaker D: Writing them or getting them?

Speaker C: We were really good at it.

Speaker A: Why?

Speaker E: Well, even this year we probably are comparatively.

Speaker C: Thoughtful and creative. A lot of experience.

Speaker H: Connections with the people reviewing them too.

Speaker D: Yeah, so much about that and connections with partners that we make them with that are also. Well what kinds of partners we have like universities. Well a lot of them are like a little bit special but like still the name like we'll get you in even though the people are completely incompetent.

Speaker C: Universities and other organizations as grant Writer here. You know what I think why we've been successful is we're able to identify and creatively solve unique, interesting problems and clearly articulate what that is. Right? Like that, you know, it's, we're not doing the same old same old typically. That's why we're good at getting these questions, grants as we've come up with, you know, the interesting solutions to the big problem. And I feel like, you know, if in my field like I have able to articulate like this is a good problem for us to solve, this is not. We can do this, we cannot do that. And to know that is important because then it translates into extraordinarily interesting materials.

Speaker A: To what extent does that translate into or support perhaps I should say the North Star stars of problem solving, critical thinking and domain based reasoning.

Speaker C: It's a big deal because it's translating what should be, what we're thinking should be taught and learned as opposed to what has traditionally been taught and how.

Speaker D: Right?

Speaker C: I mean the approach and how do you engage. I think that's what is, is important in that North Star because it's about the reasoning as opposed to here's, you know, let's tell you every single kind of volcano and here's a definition here, you know, who gives a rat's ass, right?

Speaker B: I think it's the, the, all the inquiry, curiosity, all that stuff is the, the underlying foundation for how do we create a solution so that we can make that thing possible. And it's because memorizing the volcano types is not helpful, right? I mean I got into it because I was teaching chemistry and waving my hands around like the molecules are all doing this and that. Like they're looking at me like what are they talking about? Right? Like I have this vision of what's going on in this invisible world and I'm trying to relate it to them, which is not a good way of teaching like telling them what stuff is. And I'm like, they need to be, they need to see this, they need to be able to experiment with it. They need to be able to, you know, change things and see how that affects what the real world outcome, the, you know, the emergent property would, how that would change the thing I actually observe. And so then that's how I got into making simulations, you know, atomic level simulations. And so it's the same. I, I mean, I imagine it's sort of the same thing. There's all these concepts like you can't. Earth science is so slow moving in.

Speaker C: A lot of cases, right?

Speaker B: Time and time and scale. So we got into modeling because of time scale, all these other things. That's where that was one of the foundational things that we worked on early on.

Speaker A: We'll get into this. But Leslie and Kylie showed me, you know, the real data that you guys depend on is. Is amazing. I think that's it.

Speaker F: Yeah, we did a demo of the.

Speaker D: That's definitely something that project once. And I don't know if it was our project or someone else's, but it was like making things visible or invisible things visible.

Speaker E: What did my dog.

Speaker C: That was, that was. That was Janice. Go birds making.

Speaker B: Right, Making thinking visible.

Speaker C: Yeah. I was hired onto that molecular workman.

Speaker D: That's the thing. So it's like we make things that.

Speaker E: You can't see inspiring pedagogically grounded technology. I mean it's those three poles. And we can't forget technology is actually the competency that's brought us where we are.

Speaker C: Well, I want to add to that which is there's at least when I was brought on here and I try to embody it is it's not technology for technology's sake.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker C: You know that there's a lot of technology that is caca. And so you know that when and how is the technology best used? Right. So you know that there's places where it doesn't make sense you should actually go out into the field or do hands on, whatever. And then there's places where the technology is actually a real enhancement to your ability to do the inquiring curiosity.

Speaker A: So next and last question before we go into the SWOT itself. Do you have a sense of how your market in the broad sense thinks of Concord? You know, it sounds to me like there's a lot of thought leadership that goes on here. Is that what you guys tend to be known for and the solutions that derive from that? Do you tend to be known more for a cool app on a virtual bookshelf that I can pull off and use for free? Tell me what you know, if anything, about the various customer groups, segments. What is Concord known for? Not by you guys, but by.

Speaker B: So it depends. I think within the tech and research field we are known in terms of thought leaders around various approaches to using technology or pedagogical approaches, things like that. I do think teachers mostly think of Concord as like, oh, they have cool tools and activities and stuff for me to use.

Speaker D: And free.

Speaker B: Free. Free is also important.

Speaker A: That's one of our big challenges, perhaps our biggest challenges. Just trying to keep up on my notes here. So let's, let's park the notion of how you're known by your peers for now, we'll come back to that.

Speaker E: But.

Speaker A: By teachers and administrators, are you better known? K through 5, middle school, high school, higher ed, no one in particular.

Speaker E: Middle and high.

Speaker C: Yeah, I'd go with that too.

Speaker B: Middle and high. Although he has had some significant elementary oriented projects.

Speaker F: As far as who, like who thinks about us.

Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you know if the thinking by that segment, the S word again, those segments middle and high is. Do you know if they're thinking about Concord is cool and free? Does that apply there?

Speaker D: I think they think about specific things like that we make like all of our dragon stuff like that is very well known and used.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker D: And then we want to keep shouting it down, but it's because that's the thing that people use the most and it costs money. So we shut it down, even though that's our most popular thing. But like, but you're not. I think it's hard when we have like these products and then we're Concord Consortium. But like is the product associated with Concord Consortium or are they thinking like it's two different things or two different people? Like we've had that happen in the past.

Speaker A: We'll talk about brand. I think there's opportunity, opportunity there.

Speaker F: I think it's my impression that it depends on what subject you teach.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker F: Like if you're a biologist, you know about the dragons. If you're, you know, an earth scientist, you know about Amy's collection of stuff. Right. It's. And they don't. I don't think it's important unless you are teaching science. And then if you're doing that then you're like in fifth grade or fourth grade or something. Right. But if you're a middle school science teacher, you have a specialty of some sort and, and that's what you know us for. And I've had conversations with people where they are very surprised to find that, you know, we have a product that knows how to talk to, you know, robotic sensors. They're like, oh, you guys do that? I thought you just did, you know, dragons. Because that was my thing that I cared about.

Speaker C: Sure.

Speaker D: Yeah. Science teachers are very like domain specific individuals.

Speaker A: Part of the challenge here with the whole segmentation thing, you've got segments on top of segments because it's by discipline, it's by level.

Speaker F: And that's an industry wide problem.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker F: Like part of the reason that these, these folks have trouble convincing anybody to make stuff that's great for them. Because, you know, there are only like three biology teachers and five chemistry teachers. You know, like, there's not a science thing that a company can go after wholeheartedly.

Speaker A: All right, well, this gets us into the main attraction here, arguably.

Speaker F: I mean, unless people disagree with that.

Speaker A: Well, it's because I happen to agree. Agree with what you're saying. Branding broadly, it seems to me to be an opportunity for you guys so that concord is more front of mind with the biology teacher, so that when they're in the faculty room and they're talking with the earth science teacher. Oh, and I don't sense that happens much now that there's not branding associated with what I've seen.

Speaker E: I don't know. Yeah, not necessarily. I mean, yes and no, but as much no as yes and as much no. I don't know.

Speaker B: All the URLs have concord.org yeah.

Speaker E: I mean, the other side of it is that it's really bimodal whether you know us or not. I'd say 20% maybe of the potential teachers might know us. I think it's very unusual for people to know us and not respect the work. I think we're highly. We always say we're really well known among people know us well. We're highly respected among that subset. But there are lots of people who don't know us at all.

Speaker B: And I would agree and emphasize. Agree with the notion that someone might be like, they. They're really into the genetic stuff or the earth science stuff and have no idea that we do anything else. Right, right. I've shown people, like, they say, oh, well, I'm interested in such and such thing. I'm like, well, do you know we also have this. And they're like, oh, my God, no, I didn't know.

Speaker D: Like the conquered portal, instead of the one might associate the words.

Speaker A: I hadn't put it quite that way.

Speaker B: Can we call it the conquered STEM resource finder portal?

Speaker E: I can say this for so long.

Speaker G: It's really a shame Cynthia is not.

Speaker A: Well, that's kind of what I was getting at, though, in terms of the branding opportunities. But we can explore that further.

Speaker C: I can go home now, and this.

Speaker G: Is why I invited Trudy.

Speaker A: So we're into it now. So. And I'm sorry I don't have the benefit of having looked at what you guys provided already, but I think that's kind of okay. Let's get into first. Let's get into strengths and opportunities. We've talked about some of this, that you guys are thought leaders. What Would you This is your move. What do you consider conquered strengths?

Speaker G: I was just going to say I can read off Cynthia was able to run this through chat GPT and summarize everything that we put in our homework so I can read off some of the headlines. Go ahead of our strengths. So educational innovation and expertise Me, you know just kind of cutting edge inquiry based educational tools.

Speaker B: Simulation did that before I contributed simulations.

Speaker G: Data science modeling, diverse educational products. So so so but yeah I would say simulations and models.

Speaker A: Together or separate.

Speaker G: Both I think is fine.

Speaker B: Well the simulations and there's modeling and modeling. There's modeling could be more general tools.

Speaker E: I mean we could get very granular about that. Hall.

Speaker B: Well I think it's very different.

Speaker E: No, I know it is. I'm just saying modeling data like we list the seven.

Speaker G: There's another headline of like research and development excellence. Some of the things that.

Speaker A: What does that mean?

Speaker G: Talked about about basically being really good at writing grants and we're much better.

Speaker D: At that than we used to be.

Speaker G: We have a you know, kind of a team, a well versed team that have experience in things like software engineering and you know, research and analysis.

Speaker F: Educational problem solving.

Speaker E: Yeah right.

Speaker A: With technology goes without saying.

Speaker E: We also have a deep base of resources and technology tools that can be you know integrated with one another into other things etc. There's those assets, expertise to work with those.

Speaker G: That was one of the next headlines is organizational assets which is our library of resources and authoring tools which are.

Speaker F: Never as tinker toy as everybody really kind of hopes that they would be. But it's better than nothing, you know.

Speaker A: Yeah, far better. What else are we missing? Anything on strength?

Speaker B: I mean we have a experienced development.

Speaker E: Group.

Speaker B: Like a lot of universities that get into doing tech ed. They have some graduate students who are around for a few months and do a little programming. Like we have a deep bench or we do that.

Speaker G: We did have a human capital is what Chachi.

Speaker B: Yeah, I guess human capital.

Speaker C: We have a dollar.

Speaker B: But you know we have people who care about education who are on the programming side. Like they're not just like here's the spec execute it and they're not well generally not transient.

Speaker E: We also have a honed ability to get you know to work with changing funding landscape while keeping our North Star I guess is a way of saying it.

Speaker A: Say that again John.

Speaker E: We've been through lots of different changes in what kinds of funding have asked for and kept our North Star and been able to get funding. So we're good at getting funding for the work that we need to. That we think is important. Probably not. I mean that's a short way of saying. Right. That's a short way of staying good at getting federal grants regardless of what.

Speaker C: They say they want to.

Speaker E: But the nuance underneath it is that, you know, NSF all of a sudden changed to doing research and we kept doing what we do and added research and we didn't like explosion.

Speaker G: Yeah.

Speaker A: So you guys are nimble is what that sounds.

Speaker E: I think. Yes. Nimble is a very good.

Speaker F: All of these are strengths. If what you are trying to do is build more novel stuff, I occasionally wonder if they are also weaknesses.

Speaker A: There's going to be some of that.

Speaker E: Yes. Hold that thought. It will be.

Speaker A: Let's get into what we see as opportunities. Then we'll come to weaknesses and threats.

Speaker G: Read what Jack GPT thinks.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker G: About our. Well, what we think about what Chat GPT was able to summarize what we think. Strategic growth paths, meaning expanding into new markets like workforce training or adult education, pursuing licensing deals.

Speaker A: That's. That's what you can do if you're nimble.

Speaker E: But the notion of expansion I think is opportunities.

Speaker B: This sounds like areas in which we could expand.

Speaker E: Right? There are. I mean so the opportunities are. There are. Or there could be workforce, et cetera, might be opportunities.

Speaker A: So chat to your point, that's both by topic and by level or.

Speaker E: Yeah, potentially. I mean basically we have. There are unexploited markets or unexploited, you know, market opportunities in some way, shape or form. By market I might mean funding or research or what have you. But we've done nothing in workforce or areas.

Speaker B: Right. I mean we have opportunities to potentially provide wraparound services to the free things. That's an opportunity.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker D: PD for the free things that we have.

Speaker B: PD or enhanced, you know, reports or blogging or something like that.

Speaker A: Boil this down for me. Couple of words if you can.

Speaker B: I mean I guess I would wrap.

Speaker G: Around services.

Speaker A: Add ons.

Speaker H: Service add ons.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker G: Fee based.

Speaker D: Yeah, Fee based. Things that go around the free.

Speaker B: Free base.

Speaker E: Yeah. Services and offerings, I guess.

Speaker B: Did you just say freebase?

Speaker E: I think.

Speaker D: Okay, settle down.

Speaker A: And if important thing.

Speaker B: What are you taking for that? Ne.

Speaker D: I think.

Speaker G: The next kind of subcategory is AI and technology leverage. So kind of expanding into the world of AI powered accessibility, coding, navigation. AI.

Speaker A: Yeah, no, I got AI.

Speaker G: So I think that. Well there's like. It's kind of. There's. From what the group as a collective has said, there's kind of two strands. It's like integrating AI into our existing software. Right. So adding, I guess, new features. Perhaps you could call it that leverage AI.

Speaker B: Could I call it like student facing AI stuff? There's teacher facing AI stuff, then there's using AI to develop. Develop new product kinds of stuff.

Speaker A: There are those segments again. So there are kind of two.

Speaker G: Two sets and you could probably add a third branch to that and maybe is using AI to streamline simulation model development, enabling. Like this is kind of like an internal thing, but like faster prototyping, essentially.

Speaker B: Yeah, well, it's internal, but I also think we could potentially help other organizations figure out how to do that as well.

Speaker G: Right, that's true.

Speaker B: I was talking to my wife and she works for a publishing company and we were talking about, you know, they do math stuff and they have math interactives, but they're basically told anytime they want a new interactive, it's way too hard, it's way too much work, it'll take way too many resources. And I'm like, they're still telling you that that means they don't know how to use the new AI tool here.

Speaker E: Yeah. So there's AI for education, student and teacher facing. There's AI like based infrastructure improvements. There's being experts infrastructure for you guys. Infrastructure for us is an opportunity. There's AI expertise as a sort of service offering to the world in some way. It's also AI literacy, which is another frame of that.

Speaker G: Those are basically, you know.

Speaker A: The world is teachers, students.

Speaker E: It might be us as AI experts might be an opportunity for whom? For. For clients. That was what Dan was describing. Or. Or some others who might not have as much expertise for.

Speaker F: For professional people.

Speaker B: Yeah. For like publishers.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker E: For educational publishers, entities.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker E: We could teach them to do what.

Speaker D: Dan said his wife's company can't do.

Speaker B: Right. So one, for one. One example in which this, like, as a specific example, I would say we've been like. So one project I have now is using AI around accessibility and maybe even. Or developing some accessibility expertise as part of that. But so I have another group that wants to do a project together because they want to do AI and accessibility. And so they're coming to us to do that. Of course they go funding from the same resource sources as us.

Speaker F: Perkins.

Speaker B: Like no, GMRI wants to do. They want to. They want to use AI to make field science more accessible. So both in the data collection and analysis part, so we're trying to figure out which part of that we want to focus on. And basically we build off of stuff that we have here. But I think that's a potentially. I mean, I don't know how big an area it might be, but it seems to me like it's one of the promises that would be useful for AI would be to help with accessibility.

Speaker A: Anything else? I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker D: I think AI can like help us do some of the other things, like in our strengths, like we have all these products that like are hard for a teacher, a regular teacher to teach because you need to understand how to teach with them and they are in great based and that's hard to do. So AI can help with teaching those things.

Speaker E: Right. So as an on ramp or sort of onboarding assistance can make the. Make the ramp shallower for people.

Speaker A: Onboarding is a weakness.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker B: Right. I would say since our, the goals of we've talked about or the vision or whatever we talked about at the beginning, it's not easy. It's not a standard way, it's not a worksheet. And so for people to actually get the most out of the kinds of tools or products or curriculum that we develop, it really takes significant professional development. And it would be nice if it didn't take significant time, like one on one person time. Maybe we could have something that would help onboard people better.

Speaker D: And even when we're evaluating, reasoning, like in a lot of the projects that I've done with Amy, like we ask about like, you know, how do you think that? Why do you think that? What's going on? And like teachers don't want to read those answers because they don't have time. Not that they don't want to read them and they don't care. They do care. But if there was something integrated that would tell the teacher, like, this is the what you're doing. Kids are thinking. These are their misconceptions. This group of people have this misconception. It's like what we tried to do with Jenna. Whatever one that we tried to do. Like there are a lot of opportunities, like from the beginning of onboarding to like actually using the thing to teachers doing assessments, to students getting feedback. There's so many different steps that we could use.

Speaker A: AI, is it both appropriate and charitable to say that a weakness? I don't know if it's a weakness or maybe even a threat is teacher load.

Speaker D: Yes, yes. They have so much to do.

Speaker B: I would say it's a threat. You know, the complexity of what we offer.

Speaker E: Yeah, no, there are lots of people who are like, I can't even. I can't even. That's A threat.

Speaker C: Can I put a personal opportunity on there? Like, you know, I do think that, that the Earth science simulations with a few more, we have the potential to make a big ass deal difference in our science education.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker C: You know, so that's an opportunity.

Speaker E: Opportunity. Right corner the corner of the market.

Speaker B: In Earth science education.

Speaker C: Yep, that's exactly what I was going to say.

Speaker D: In the first corner, Amy Palace.

Speaker G: We're going to get you, we're going to get you a trophy.

Speaker C: Right, right. I mean this requires additional funding. But I do think that what we've created and how we approach Earth science is unique.

Speaker E: That's one of our weaknesses.

Speaker C: So you know, like if you can put up AI, I can put up Earth science. That's sort of what I'm saying.

Speaker E: No question. No, I think, I mean, I think, I think an opportunity is that we could make an Earth science curriculum that could be on fully unequaled.

Speaker G: I don't, I think also like not just current, like I think we should be careful about using the word curriculum. Right. And that's something Leslie and I were talking is like it's, I think part of the opportunities that we have and maybe it's folded into something that's already up there, but it's like opportunities to provide curriculum at short scale, like short term or long term and also just products like standalone things that can be used by any learner. And I think it kind for me it, the way I think about it is in terms of branding and visibility is like, you know, kind of going back to the question of like what do we want to be known for? What are we known for?

Speaker A: We'll get to that.

Speaker G: Known for, you know, who, who knows us for it kind of thing.

Speaker A: To what extent, to what extent are, are you guys or would the kind of narrower topical solutions be a strength versus broader curricular solutions?

Speaker E: I think tomato, tomato, that supplementary offerings. Kylie would list it under opportunities and I would list it under weaknesses. I think the fact that we only have supplementary opportunities almost we don't have full gear.

Speaker G: I don't disagree with that.

Speaker B: And it's being used.

Speaker G: Yeah, I think significantly, I think that's primarily what we're known for like you said. And I think, and this is why I kind of think about it as in terms of branding and visibility is like, you know, there's a weakness of like onboarding and there's a threat of, you know, the load on teachers. It's like if we are known for these kind of unique standalone things that can just be used to supplement it's. Like that, that should be seen as a good thing to a teacher. Not necessarily.

Speaker D: There aren't enough of those things. We have the best things.

Speaker F: Right.

Speaker C: So, so I wanna, I wanna, you know, like I could put in each quadrant the way the earth science would fall.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker C: You know, so, so the opportunity would also be, you know, professional development or you know, around this transformation, it's adding, you know, in earth science, it's also adding new simulations that are unique. The weaknesses are that earth science is undervalued and not taught in schools as much. Their weaknesses are, you know, they're complex simulations and though they're super easy to use, sort of the best learning comes with a little bit more scaffolding. And you know, the, the threats are. AI wants everything to be super meh.

Speaker B: Least common denominator in terms of our materials. So that we have a range of stuff. We, we have like simulation that could be dropped in whatever teacher can wrap whatever they want around. That's the super simple, the lowest like chunk that we have. Less, less complex than some of the earth science ones. So we have you know, simulations that have like two to four little controls I can knob around on and they're mostly focused on a particular concept. And then we have more complex simulations which are like the earth science ones. But again these are still things that could maybe be done in a day or a few days. Then there's like, we were like, we really need to teach about doing inquiry. And I'm most guilty probably of this, of creating like six weeks on like this one gas law. You know, let's spend six weeks on this because I can, I can make a really interesting six weeks around this and like they'll end with knowledge that they can apply to all kinds of things. And, but teachers are never going to do that. We have a lot of multi week curriculum that's too big to fit into their current curriculum. It's really good content. I don't know what to do with it. And then we have like the, you know, we have our like one full semester course. And I can't tell you how many times I've heard people ask like, do you have a whole course on. Like they see a piece of something they do like do you have a whole course like this? And I have to say no, we don't have that.

Speaker F: I would say that the weakness that you're describing is that we are hard to adopt.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker F: Because we don't fit people's existing model.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker F: If they have complete control over their classroom and they don't have to worry about state standards, and they don't have to worry about, you know, blah, blah. And it's totally fine for them to teach nothing but the gas law.

Speaker C: So that's an opportunity in earth science. Cause there's no standardized testing.

Speaker F: Yeah, cool.

Speaker E: But you're right. And you know. Yes. And Leslie, like, if they, if they, if they. And if they can get their head around what we offer, like, the coda to that weakness is that we don't have a product line or lines that are understandable. Like, you go into the Apple Store and it's small, medium, large. You know, like you go into. It's like walking into Wal Drugs. Cynthia just posted about it. I mean, like, that's what we are. Lots of amazing things and we go on endlessly. Right. And if you've got two hours to walk through Wall drugs, you'll find something that's cool.

Speaker A: So you guys have jackalopes?

Speaker E: Yeah, sure do. Lots of them.

Speaker B: Simulated jackalopes.

Speaker H: One more thing we're talking about categories of stuff we have is the tools.

Speaker B: Yeah, I was.

Speaker H: So there's like Sage Modeler and Codab, which are. And, and maybe Count Clue that are like generic tools that could be used in lots of different areas. And so they're not specific to one thing.

Speaker E: And we see different adoption because people can get their head around how to. Where that fits in their paradigm. I would, I would argue.

Speaker D: So we could teach people that would be like a PD thing. How to use codep in your.

Speaker E: Whatever you teach or. Sure, that's the opportunity among many others.

Speaker B: I mean, I think part of it is. And this is in our weakness is we don't have a marketing sales department. So there are, there are things that people could adopt would be. You know, people have asked me in workshops all the time, do you do professional development? So my other people, you know, at my school could learn this. But, you know, I'm like, well, if they're part of the project that we're running, I mean, this, this thing where we mentioned that stuff is very complex for people to adopt. It's not so complex for the people who are part of our research cohort. So, like, you know, they're involved and they have, you know, significant PD and da, da, da. And then like, the project is over. We have this amazing thing and we put it out there and it's too hard for any random person to just grab it off the shelf.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker D: But that's not necessarily true. We have a lot of things about. Are being used by lots and Lots of people who were not impeding.

Speaker B: I'm not saying they can't try and use them. I'm just saying they're not necessarily using them to the best. To the best benefit that we think they should be.

Speaker A: Is that a messaging issue or is that a technology issue or.

Speaker B: We literally don't have any budget to like, let people know these things exist. We put them on our website and it goes out. Nice newsletter.

Speaker E: It's a design and sensibility issue. We have all the money in the world, but we don't design for marketing and productization.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker E: Like, there are people who have used NSF grants and productized the heck out of them because they prioritize that and decide that they didn't want to finish those last three features, but the last year they would spend, you know, homing in on hardening.

Speaker C: We used to do an imd, Right. It was required for publishers to take it at the end.

Speaker E: Yeah. And you know, and there are barriers. There are lots of natural barriers built into the grants that would make it difficult to do that. Well, but more, first and foremost, we like toys and we kind of don't care if they're rough.

Speaker G: It does seem like we're trading features for marketing all the time.

Speaker D: Yeah. The features win geeky part.

Speaker C: Well, and again, that's because our audience was nsf.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker C: And NSF required research.

Speaker E: Well.

Speaker C: And we're the ones implementing it.

Speaker E: And as a result, we gathered ourselves and our DNA was baked in that something. I came here because the way geeky toys and I wanted to build geeky toys. That's awesome. It's fun, right? Yeah.

Speaker B: I don't know how much the story or the history of the organization is relevant. So way back now I won't. But basically, you know, when it started, it was. Was a small, like R and D. We will, like, see how technology can be applied and other people will take our ideas and make commercial products of them. And we're just. We're funded by NSF to like, make the idea happen and see who will take it on. And, you know, this happened with sensors and it happened with the virtual high school. And even. Even around after that time, it was still too expensive for us. Us to be the publisher. Like, it was just the. But what's happened sort of over time? Well, I would say there's always been a struggle between, I'll speak for myself, wanting to like, develop the thing and wanting to get it out to lots of people. I don't want to spend my time doing the marketing and getting out to lots of people. I want to spend my time imagining the new thing and building it and trying. Right. And so in the past it really wasn't even feasible to do the marketing again. We couldn't host something that a million people could access. It would cost way too much. You know, we had our servers in the closet. Like, you know, we weren't trying to run all that. Didn't everybody at 100, you know, but we kind of like the technologies come in where the like the distribution. Digital distribution cost has come way down. And so I think now it's almost taken for granted that like we should be able to put something up and then serves a million. But we never had a business model that would pay even the small that we would need to serve the millions with today's current technology.

Speaker E: And we have been successful at the former goal, whether it's the old probes and virtual high school story or more recently. I mean there's a business called Tuba that looks a whole lot like CODAP because we talked to them as they were starting out. We just talked to, explored learning folks and the explorer learning folks said yeah. We looked at modeling, got some really good ideas for that that we incorporated into the last couple years of our dynamic modeling. We simplified it, made it easier for people to use. But you know, we, those ideas came from that. So we have done that role doesn't pay us anything. But that hasn't mattered because it hasn't mattered because we give millions of dollars to do that something. Right.

Speaker D: That's the other problem. Like more people are doing this. When we started, we were the only people doing this.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker D: So we were super cool. But now everybody's doing it, which brings us.

Speaker A: Us into threats.

Speaker E: Threats. Yeah, totally.

Speaker A: So let's.

Speaker F: Before you move on.

Speaker G: I was just gonna say let me. Before we move on from weaknesses, I just want to. There's.

Speaker D: We've covered.

Speaker A: We can always go back to these two.

Speaker G: We covered most everything. But I think something we didn't really talk about in this list is like internal organization. So there's. We kind of have like siloed. Siloed teams of. Of people working in various domains. There's not a lot of cross collaboration content, you know, that way. And because of the structure of our funding and staff, we typically have very slow cycles of development. And you know, it's like over the course of three, four, five years we've finally end up with a product that is again not scalable or really a product.

Speaker C: Can I add another which is everybody is. Is running after AI Money. AI, AI, AI.

Speaker E: That's all you hear about, that's a threat.

Speaker C: Well, I think a weakness is that we were, we're, we're coming from behind. You know, we're not the AI leaders to start with. So, so I do think though the capacity and our intelligence is going to be way different. I think convincing is, is going to be a little bit harder.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker B: Another side of that coin though is also where that's where all the funding is going and we have interests outside of AI. We do think that technology isn't just.

Speaker A: AI if it's good enough for Apple.

Speaker E: Yeah, right, right.

Speaker C: No, I mean, I just, you know, it, it, I, I, I do worry about sort of coming from behind to try to get.

Speaker E: So I would say there's a disconnect.

Speaker A: Because you guys are thought leaders in many respects, but not in the hottest topic.

Speaker C: Right, right.

Speaker E: So, so I would reframe it just a little bit. Which is to say our, a core weakness of ours is the tendency to be so on the front edge that we get leapfrogged sometimes. And AI is an example of that. There are lots of times when we're hearing about these cutting edge things that we're like, oh, that's a few years away. It's not going to happen. We'll wait till, and then it can get underneath us and then we can find ourselves a little bit behind. Another weakness is our thinking that we are more behind than we are because we are so tech forward. So I think I have your view and at the same time realize am I going anywhere? That everybody is doing AI in such a crazy shallow way that actually they're not. Right.

Speaker C: I mean that's a little bit of both strength. It comes back to sort of who we have in terms of the thoughtfulness around it. But you know, as we've had trouble sort of articulating like what makes us special, you know, that kind of thing. You know, AI people have ideas. Right. And so I just, you know, I, Yeah, right. And you know, from my perspective, like, you know, AI, you know, falls into buckets one which is like everything is, you know, all the shit that's being put out there and, and how much we're also destroying our environment because of it and, and the money that's not there supporting it. It's like it was a, as Leslie put it, it was solving a problem we didn't have. And, and where it's useful, which is I, where I think we should be, you know, putting all of our effort. You know, that's stuff is, you know, much more targeted. And, and when you just use the word AI, you, you, you think about all that other stuff as opposed to the, the really target. And I don't know what those words are because I'm not seeing that as much.

Speaker E: Yeah. So the, I would say the sea of AI is a threat. Like getting drowned in the sea of AI that's out there parsing AI.

Speaker A: Fair to say.

Speaker E: Maybe.

Speaker B: Do you mean like standing out?

Speaker E: Yes. I think that like the, the, the AI noise of the world is a threat to our ability to differentiate.

Speaker F: It's just the proliferation of a bad AI AI slope.

Speaker C: People getting, especially in education, having not good experiences, you know, like.

Speaker G: Right. It started out with AI was used for plagiarism.

Speaker B: I think that's still the primary use.

Speaker C: Well, and, and that, you know, the, the, the teachers and whatever are starting to see just like, you know, the rush to mediocrity with it all, which is everybody's got the same formula because you can see AI writing it for all of these kids and whatever, you know.

Speaker E: Yeah. So there's, there's one layer that's this sort of AI clamor and getting lost in the noise. I think that second one touches on a bigger topic which probably came out in checks out summary. But I put in mind that there's a, almost a backlash, if not a backlash against technology in schools. There's certainly a reluctance slash adoption barrier that was not there even three or four years ago.

Speaker D: Because Covid turned everyone off of computers.

Speaker E: No one wants to be well. And it ended massively, massively increased the offerings and, and print people off all at the same time.

Speaker D: Yeah. So then we were in as cool.

Speaker E: We.

Speaker D: In the beginning of COVID our numbers were huge, like our usage numbers. And then they fell off because other people were doing. Giving offerings. Yes, well, and, and kids just got tired of it and teachers did too. There's a lot now my son was telling me that he gets like those old, you know, those black and white books.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker D: Yes. They get those books now in both high school, college because they don't want kids on the computer.

Speaker A: That's in the future.

Speaker D: And the kids.

Speaker F: Are just tired of it.

Speaker D: So that's a problem for us because all of our stuff is on a computer now. If Jay was here, she would say we should go after virtual schools because those kids stare at a computer all day and seem very happy not talking to anyone.

Speaker F: I'm really not trying to get behind this.

Speaker A: You're driving the mirrors.

Speaker C: No, but.

Speaker D: When we interviewed them, we.

Speaker C: Were like, well, who do you talk to?

Speaker D: Like at the virtual school? And they're like, no one.

Speaker E: Huh.

Speaker D: You talk to any of the other kids? No, I don't even know who they are. Do you know any of them?

Speaker E: That's our North Star right there.

Speaker B: So we make AI buddies for them.

Speaker D: Yeah.

Speaker F: Don't think she hasn't asked me to build.

Speaker E: Exactly.

Speaker C: I want to make an AI.

Speaker A: You want to make an AI for.

Speaker D: The virtual school kids?

Speaker F: Make virtual friends for the virtual schools kids.

Speaker D: We totally need a friend.

Speaker A: Scott Stewart was.

Speaker B: He.

Speaker A: Said the difference between antisocial engineer.

Speaker C: In their basements and they can't get dates.

Speaker A: Social engineer looks at his own shoes.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker C: No, seriously, like this whole problem in the mound sphere is that people have lost the ability to talk to each other.

Speaker E: I don't know what he's talking about.

Speaker B: Are you commenting on this group? You asked me if I would like.

Speaker G: To eat some of these. Yes, you can eat these too.

Speaker A: Before we move on we'll take a break in a few minutes just to kind of catch our breath. But let's first of all do we have everything submitted in terms of weaknesses? Do we have.

Speaker G: Weaknesses? I think the only other thing I see that's not really up there is just our like historical heavy reliance on restricted federal funding and which then kind of also lacks. It prevents us from. We have a limited unrestricted fund.

Speaker E: That's assortment it.

Speaker F: Yeah.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker D: But we've also been looking for private funding since chat started. That was like.

Speaker E: That was sort of. We've been talking about looking for it.

Speaker B: We certainly have more than we ever do.

Speaker G: We've accepted it.

Speaker D: We definitely have. But it's like it's a ramp.

Speaker C: Well do we put threat that NSF is going to be half the size?

Speaker E: Yes, yes.

Speaker G: That is a funding landscape and instability.

Speaker A: Basically underput funding landscape.

Speaker G: And I said may not exist.

Speaker B: Well in the ED department of ed.

Speaker D: One is general and thinking, just thinking.

Speaker B: Over.

Speaker A: What do we say funding landscape shifts.

Speaker G: Well an increased competition for the.

Speaker E: That was the other thing.

Speaker C: Elon Musk.

Speaker G: Can we just write his name?

Speaker F: It looks like a national threat.

Speaker C: Well so I'm going big. Go big or go home.

Speaker D: We're a global threat right now.

Speaker C: We are.

Speaker A: Which is both temporary and existential at the same time in my opinion.

Speaker D: I don't know if it's.

Speaker A: Like well.

Speaker D: Wish yeah we all moving.

Speaker A: It doesn't change.

Speaker E: So another one of the might have been captured but I'm not sure is that there's a mismatch between the business development timeline cycle timeline and our Runway.

Speaker G: Yeah.

Speaker C: Yeah, that's a big one.

Speaker E: Visit our financial Runway.

Speaker G: Current right now, it is short.

Speaker E: If we had five years of time to play, it would be a different story than if we've got 12 to 18 months of time to play. And in a world where relationships and the trends develop over three years, I.

Speaker F: Would have said two.

Speaker E: But two work happens through year three and a half or two and a half.

Speaker A: One of the things we touched on but we haven't really opened up in terms of threats is. Is our. Your competition?

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker G: Yeah, that's something that's also on here in our list of.

Speaker E: How is it described in there?

Speaker A: Before you even get to that, let me ask the group, who's your competitor? Who are your take? Top two or three competitors? Is that even a fair question?

Speaker E: Well, it's a very fair question.

Speaker F: In which segment?

Speaker A: Yes.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker F: Because that answer changes.

Speaker A: Yes.

Speaker F: In sims, it's phet.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker C: Right.

Speaker F: Which those of us in this room would have a lot to say about why that's an unfair comparison. But nevertheless, it's what the. It's what the world thinks. I would say that gizmos are a competitor.

Speaker E: Yes. A competitor in that same space in classrooms. It's quizlet.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker E: It's the fact that five minutes is. Five minutes of multiple choice is just right. So. Yes, both.

Speaker B: And okay, so I get it. They're a threat because we're in competition for classroom minutes, but they're not really a threat in terms of we produce something like that and people are choosing between our five minute multiple choice thing and their five minute multiple.

Speaker E: This is. This is where we get into the. Like, why do we not need a symposium? Because we talked to them. We already know. Well, yes, except for when you look at 100 teachers, like 85 of them say conquered who? And then you say this great. Three week. You said never mind.

Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.

Speaker E: You know, so I mean, so that's a threat to us because our market is tiny.

Speaker C: I'm gonna put in Open sayed as a. As. As a competitor because of we're wanting to think about curriculum, you know, whatever. Openside has got a name brand. People know of it.

Speaker B: They do use Kodap and Sage modeler in their curriculum.

Speaker C: They use Seismic Explorer in it.

Speaker E: Yep. They don't pay us.

Speaker C: They don't pay us anything.

Speaker B: Well, they did pass for one thing, didn't they?

Speaker E: The magnet that they barely used. Yeah.

Speaker H: My kids use Vernier instead of CODAP for data analysis.

Speaker E: Yep, yep.

Speaker F: Premier is a. Is a. I mean, tuba is a. Is A competitor.

Speaker C: NASA is a competitor.

Speaker B: That's why you don't need to worry about those.

Speaker G: That's an opportunity.

Speaker B: They're gone.

Speaker D: All of our stuff that's powered by data from those places. Like what's going to happen?

Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker C: Like if they shut down. USGS size make the explorer goes away.

Speaker E: Why?

Speaker B: Well, just doesn't have any volcanoes.

Speaker G: Snapshot the data.

Speaker E: What was a curricular organization you mentioned Open sed.

Speaker A: Why are you giving away your.

Speaker D: Because we are not a real business. We don't sell things.

Speaker E: That's exactly.

Speaker D: We make things and we give them out for free. That's why we don't have marketing, we don't have sales. We never sold anything ever.

Speaker B: Well, we have licensed something.

Speaker E: That's a. That's a fair. That's a fair comment, though. Pretty much.

Speaker B: We did sell a book at one point.

Speaker G: Nobody reads anymore.

Speaker E: We sold Fathoms on online learning.

Speaker B: It was on online learning and facilitating.

Speaker D: Oh yeah.

Speaker E: Oh my God.

Speaker G: That was 30 years.

Speaker B: Sarah and Cynthia.

Speaker D: Ollie book. It wasn't online though. It was like a book.

Speaker C: It was a book.

Speaker E: It was not.

Speaker C: It's about online stuff.

Speaker B: I think we earned, you know, multiple thousands of dollars in revenue from that book.

Speaker G: Hundreds of dollars.

Speaker A: So it's covered the bowl of nuts.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker C: Right, right.

Speaker D: We once had a cake with a.

Speaker E: Picture of a book on it. So it's hard to know whether our sort of lack of or quote unquote business model falls into weaknesses or threats are both. You know, I think the free thing is. Is a more on the threat side or overcoming that. The lack of business model in our DNA is on the weakness side.

Speaker B: But this was also a conscious choice. It makes it sound like we, you know, by accident forgot to ask people for money. It's been in our philosophy. The whole like Bob founding person was that this is about equity.

Speaker E: I've got weakness because I've had contacts. It doesn't. I mean it doesn't stop me. It just exists. Right.

Speaker B: I'm just saying that I want to. I want to put it in context.

Speaker E: Yeah, sure. No, I mean I lose my context. I can't get around. It's a weakness.

Speaker B: Part of. But part of why. The reason I want to bring this up is because it's part of what, you know, drew people here. It's part of the overall philosophy, you know, that we, we make open source things. We don't want price to be a barrier to adoption. You know, it was about equity and education. So You. You know, the many of us are or were allergic to the idea of selling things.

Speaker D: Money. We didn't do this for money.

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker D: This is for love, not money.

Speaker E: Yeah. That's how we.

Speaker D: So asking us like, why do we not have money?

Speaker A: Those are not mutually exclusive.

Speaker D: Puts it a little bit of like a safe. Right? Girl, those don't have to.

Speaker A: Here to tell you those don't have to be mutually exclusive things. And even coming from the commercial edtech publishing learning company world, nobody I know went into those to be rich. Right. They would have gone to Fidelity or other places. So there is a shared value system.

Speaker C: There's a reason we're not on Mountain Head.

Speaker A: Yes, well, I saw that just the other.

Speaker E: I was.

Speaker A: So those aren't mutually exclusive. One thing I will toss in. I was going to hold this for another time, but don't confuse being able to sell with having a salesforce or even, you know, marketing and sales. You got to know what your product needs to be able to do before yours and you need to enable your markets. There's so much more leading up to the point at which you send somebody out to the field virtually or physically or otherwise. And I dare say I don't think you guys are. You haven't been thinking of that way. So you're not there yet.

Speaker E: What? Yeah, can you say more about that?

Speaker C: Say a couple more sentences about that.

Speaker A: This, this is the driver for the other piece of what I proposed for the meeting. In terms of getting instructors, teachers into a room, we need to make sure that the product or what we wrap around the product is addressing their needs, whether they're expressed implicit or explicit. And we need to know how to talk about that to them in language they'll understand, you know, in the. I don't know if you guys are familiar with the elevator pitch. You know, you get 20 seconds to try to get their attention. And the one I keep coming back to with regard to Concord is lmsatis.

Speaker E: Excuse me, what does that mean?

Speaker G: God bless you.

Speaker A: Setting it up such that every one of your key products, if you want to call it that, can report to Google Classroom Gradebook without having the extra step or, or single sign on all those kinds of things. They may not be as important for your audience.

Speaker G: Oh, they totally aren't.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I just said that. To me, that's just. That's one thing from my. My own experience that I expect we'll hear from talking to instructors. And that's kind of what I meant. More than kind of. That's what I Meant by making sure that because we think it's a great idea isn't enough because we think it because it works and does what it's supposed to isn't enough. How do we. How do we get the other side of the Velcro in place?

Speaker C: Well, I guess my question back at you before the break is it doesn't have to be all of Concord stuff either.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker C: Like we can choose a lane to try to go down. Do we have you know like trying to define all of Concord doesn't into one thing doesn't make sense because we're so fragmented.

Speaker A: Anyways, I take that a step further. I. I will recommend reinforced by just what I've already heard in the conversations now and leading up to this that some decisions need to be made on how to narrow down your focus. I mean by definition you have to. You don't have the resources you did a week ago.

Speaker E: That's true.

Speaker A: So. And this hopefully will inform difficult decisions, but decisions are that are necessary if not sufficient to get to market success. Before we break one last any other anything else on any of these but particularly weaknesses and threats that we haven't captured? No, I don't feel like we have enough on competition. What's the competition doing? Well, there's more competition.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker B: Is there a competition for people who.

Speaker D: Give away free stuff like Turk or like EDC or like.

Speaker B: Partly there's more in the sense that there's more competition for funding because all the funding has dried up. So even though.

Speaker A: So we have that the funding.

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker A: More competition. But in terms of competitive products. Competitive.

Speaker G: I think the only thing that's on here it just says close competitor. For example, FET is gaining mind share with simpler and more accessible offerings.

Speaker B: Yeah. Inquiry something.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker D: She got a thing for it. It was just on her. Wait.

Speaker C: What is Genesis.

Speaker B: Assistance is the Neil Heffern.

Speaker F: Makes it hard to adopt is.

Speaker E: That.

Speaker F: No matter how great the NGSS standards and inquiry based, you know thought leadership about how science should be taught has been touted. The vast majority of schools are not doing that. They have district coordinators who are saying you need to teach to this and then and Right.

Speaker E: So the threat is teaching mentality and and time and resources. I mean essentially or teacher orientation is a threat to us that you know teachers orientation is not one that can adopt our materials most of the time.

Speaker F: Like they may think it's a great idea but they're their universe, their school reality.

Speaker E: I think War and Peace is probably a really good book but I just, I can't. What am I going to do? I think it's a great book in.

Speaker B: Terms of what, you know, Leslie was talking about. I do think the state testing, I mean, I would put that there. I guess it's under teacher orientation. But so, like, when NGSS came out and they had yet to modify state standards, but all schools were trying to get out there and implement it, I finally had teachers coming to me and say, help me do modeling. Before I was saying, you should do modeling because of all these great things you would get out of it. And finally they were coming to us saying, we're told we have to do modeling. How do I do modeling? Show us how to do modeling. And then the state standardized testing hasn't really evolved, and people are like, oh, I don't really need to do modeling. I just need to get them to do this thing so they can pass.

Speaker A: Is that an opportunity also?

Speaker F: Maybe. But to your point about why don't we have more competitors on here? The reason is that our competitors are for sale commercial organizations. And so they pay very close attention to what the states.

Speaker D: Right, right.

Speaker C: State adoptions.

Speaker F: Right. So we don't consider them competitors because their stuff is nowhere near like ours.

Speaker D: Except for Janice Gobert's thing is exactly what we just talked about. It's incorporated is an online platform for middle and high school with virtual science labs aligned to science standards that use real patented AI in real time to eliminate teachers grading, support their instruction, and support students learning. So this is exactly what we talked about. Plus, they have a super cute dinosaur look.

Speaker E: Yeah. And you heard about it from whom, Brandon. Right. From which teachers did you hear that from?

Speaker D: The 49 people phone.

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker C: Come on.

Speaker E: Exactly. That's what I mean.

Speaker C: I want to say the state adoptions is an opportunity, but our weaknesses is that we have to be evaluated under, you know, like, there's specific criteria for, you know, getting our materials into those.

Speaker F: So that they become organizations that do that.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker C: You know, so.

Speaker F: And they won't evaluate you unless you have a full year curriculum.

Speaker E: Yeah, that's our.

Speaker B: Yeah. Adoptions are about curriculum, not about specific.

Speaker C: But don't they also have like, you know, here are material additional supplementary.

Speaker F: I have, I looked. I have not found yet that it's not that important. Okay.

Speaker E: Right. Yeah.

Speaker D: That's what we were hoping for for the virtual school thing. But they basically, it's just classes.

Speaker C: Right.

Speaker E: So one last. And this is not at all in those categories, but it's important. Important to recognize this historical context. One last probably significant threat is the fact that making technology stuff is becoming rapidly easier. And in the same way that print became. Or that print became a commodity and when people started to blog and all of a sudden Time magazine disappeared. We have existed because it's hard to. To make the cool stuff that we make.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker E: And that won't be the case five years from now. Whether it's the case now is arguable.

Speaker A: Are you familiar with Muddy Lane by any chance? Yeah, they've built some tools that are really impressive using AI. Tell it what you want to teach and it'll build a simulation for a game for you.

Speaker B: One of the threats that I had put on mine was AI related in the sense that it may make some of what we're doing move. Not, not in terms of building the thing, but like, okay, so I have this great tool for learning how to do data analysis, but no one does data analysis anymore because they just feed the data table to the AI and it does it all for them. It'll be like, you know, why are you doing longhand division? We have calculators.

Speaker E: Yeah. I think both side. Both sides of those efforts.

Speaker A: Yeah. Solutions looking for problems. Okay, let's take a break.

Speaker E: It is.

Speaker A: I have 224\. I just realized that's your clock. 2:22\. So let's go, you know, 2:32, take 10 minute break and then we'll come back and we're going to start to parse this out and see if we can agree on priorities among these.

Speaker B: One more opportunity I want to put on there just because.

Speaker A: Too late.

Speaker B: Starting to do it.

Speaker E: Yes. LCI integration. We are starting. That's worth noting.

Speaker A: Walking across the two different words for rough.

Speaker C: The tough run. Yeah, what you said, that was it. Yeah.

Speaker B: Okay.

Speaker A: Let'S get back into it. Put our North Star as a kind of high level North Star. Items here as a guide, reminder, guide, whatever you want to call it. Or this part of the exercise, arguably the hardest prioritizing Earth science.

Speaker C: Hardest for whom? Oh wait, wait, it's not about me, Is that what you're saying?

Speaker B: No choices of Earth or science.

Speaker A: Thinking about it somewhat more strategically, if I may. You know, it could be that, you know, we go deep on Earth science if that is going to help us, for example, get a curriculum solution more quickly. I'm not saying we should do that. I'm not saying we shouldn't. That's for you guys to decide. That's the kind of thinking I'm looking for.

Speaker C: Can I ask a question which this is more for Chad and Sue, I think, which is there's A little bit.

Speaker E: Of.

Speaker C: You know, in my mind the earth science getting to the curriculum is foundation and not necessarily, you know, this business paying for side. So are we thinking strategically like differences that way or. No, I mean there's anybody care.

Speaker E: I mean there's a really. I think we'll find there's a complicated tension between the kinds of, the variety of things we might be able to find sell to foundations and private funders and the kinds of focus that we might need to take on to make business ish stuff happen. And I think we'll probably have to live with that, you know, complicated tension that on the one hand we're like no, just do these two things and then foundations like oh, I like that little thing. Could you do more like.

Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.

Speaker E: So I think we'll have to figure it out. But the focus is a little bit.

Speaker G: Of overlap at least from what I understand between talking with Mike and Rick is that there are opportunities that lie within private foundations that want to see us succeed in going to market with certain products.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker G: So that is of interest to certain people who have money to give to say I want to see you guys be successful in selling this or in creating this type of business model where you can earn profit from X, Y and Z while still doing some of these other cool foundation funded strands of work. A little bit of overlap that we don't understand enough about yet. But I think between these two exercises.

Speaker D: What are those special things that they.

Speaker C: Said they haven't yet?

Speaker E: No, we don't know.

Speaker G: We don't know yet.

Speaker E: But we're just saying like there are cases where foundations want you to be sustainable in some way. And I think we may find that there are some cases where foundations say that's cool, you should do that. I think there are probably many fewer where we say we just think this is cool, shouldn't we do this? But if you go to a foundation saying we've heard from teachers that I think there's an opportunity to do this, we think it could really make a difference then those things, they're going to be aligned with that and be interested and those are at least adjacent to business, if not the same. Yeah.

Speaker G: That's why having these two efforts go on simultaneously is really exciting for Concord.

Speaker E: Because sometimes it feels like one or the other.

Speaker G: We haven't been able to connect them tightly.

Speaker E: Not yet.

Speaker G: Yeah, but we, I think we can.

Speaker C: Right? I, I understand that I have a very, very narrow lens, but one of the questions I have is, you know, like this tension of the earth science Being small, they don't know Earth sign. The teachers who teach it are not earth science teachers. The people who do it are like, oh, that's not the most important one. Biology is. And, and as such, sort of this, like, we can do this really cool earth science curriculum. They don't necessarily know they need it. Will they come?

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker C: And that's the question that I have in terms of like, how do you know? Because you're not going to get that in your survey. Because you're not going to have earth.

Speaker A: Science teachers not in the survey. But if that's a direction we're thinking about going, we better survey segment people responsible for earth science content, whether they're teachers of the course or maybe department chairs.

Speaker C: All right, I'll stop talking.

Speaker B: I just want to ask Amy a question. Have you. How much have you explored sort of undergraduate introductory courses in like geology, earth science, earth systems? Because it seems like, I mean, there's really a high ceiling on how much you could explore in some ways.

Speaker C: I mean, unfortunately, undergraduate professors think that they know everything and have everything. So like they're, they're much more individual as opposed to, you get.

Speaker G: Adults have been doing it for usually like 3 years and have their curriculum from 1992\.

Speaker A: Publishers who are.

Speaker C: The better place. But anyways. All right, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to derail.

Speaker E: No, but these are the earth science opportunities is a significant thing that we need to understand. I mean, it may be that we look at it and say for any of the seven reasons that you say, like, no, we have decided. No, but we need to do that, not just ignore it. Like we should concertedly decide.

Speaker D: Because when I looked this up once with Amy asked, sure, AP environmental science is like one of the fastest growing or most taken AP classes. And so, so we do have like our earth science and environmental science stuff is pretty well loved. And also not. There aren't. There's not much competition, like for wildfire stuff.

Speaker C: All right, sorry, I didn't apologize.

Speaker E: That's meaningful.

Speaker A: I mean these, these are all questions with ramifications that need to be discussed and thought about. So let's prioritize. So if I were to ask the group to pick no more than three items in each quadrant, what would it be?

Speaker E: All right, the top, the top strings, the top weaknesses, most important.

Speaker A: That's another way of saying.

Speaker E: So we're saying what's, what's the most significant three in each. Yeah.

Speaker G: Trudy's adding to our North Star population.

Speaker D: Developing a science literate population.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker G: But I Second her. Okay, it's back in the ass.

Speaker E: And sue seconded.

Speaker C: Everything. I second everything.

Speaker E: So are you asking three most significant in each category?

Speaker A: Essentially three that Concord considers most important.

Speaker E: Most meaningful significance for us.

Speaker D: We. In each.

Speaker A: In each square in each quadrant.

Speaker E: Quadrant.

Speaker G: All right, let's just start with strengths.

Speaker C: I'd say nimble is strength.

Speaker A: And obviously, you know, let opportunities and, you know, different quadrants inform the others.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker A: But this is kind of where the rubber meets the road.

Speaker D: We need those dots.

Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker E: I'm not sure.

Speaker B: I mean, we just throw them out. We're all going to say different things and then it's.

Speaker E: Yeah, let's. Let's converge. We can talk about it. I mean, the other way to go about this.

Speaker B: The other way to go about this.

Speaker A: At least for starters, is take out ones that are relatively lower priority.

Speaker D: Oh, I like that.

Speaker G: I mean, are we thinking about priority going forward or.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker E: Not going backward? I mean, is this.

Speaker G: Thank you.

Speaker A: If that's what you want to do.

Speaker C: Which is to say, yeah, I have.

Speaker G: Them all written down. So nobody can. Nobody has to panic about erasing anything. Picture is good, too.

Speaker C: I would erase the R and D excellence in paper writing.

Speaker E: Yes. I would agree with the R and.

Speaker C: D excellence in paper writing.

Speaker B: That one. I would leave everything else.

Speaker C: What is. What is the one below that?

Speaker E: Team.

Speaker G: Our team.

Speaker B: You have a team of people that.

Speaker A: Are novel problem solvers. You're human.

Speaker C: I don't see how that's that different from the capital.

Speaker B: That's very different.

Speaker C: Is the nimble cuz like the describe.

Speaker B: Different of things, though.

Speaker E: I. I see that. I see that one as. As people who can bend technology to educational will, like experience and expertise, and that making educational technology.

Speaker D: Is open. A strength or a weakness.

Speaker G: Could be both.

Speaker E: Could be both.

Speaker D: It's kind of like, let's say we built a curriculum builder for. Teachers weren't making quizzes, they were making fun interactions.

Speaker A: I see this low commercialization. Commercialism.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker C: The overlap of supplemental tools, you know, diverse products. You know, like they're. They're diverse products. Some of them are supplemental tools right now.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker B: I would say it's. It's. It's modeling. It's the tools that we have. The.

Speaker C: Are those separate or are they the same?

Speaker B: Well, the simulations, I think the sim.

Speaker E: It's really.

Speaker B: I mean, it's hard to. These things are.

Speaker E: So if you squint through the fog, it conquered. Right. I mean, I think you say, I.

Speaker B: See a light bulb.

Speaker E: Right. Take my context out. I mean, you see, like, people who can tackle I mean, so this is it, right? People who can tackle pretty much any interesting problem you put in front of them. Like that's actually a thing that we do all the time. We have 20 different projects funded. There are so many things, we can't keep track of them and we're tackling them. And you say, here's a new one. We're like, that's cool. And we lean in. And I think that is a strength that means us at this moment. Like that's probably number one. Right. Okay. That was like maybe it's not those 20, it's this one. Okay, great. Boom. Like we'll lean in on that one. So that's some combination of nimble and people with the ability. And then I think I say along with that is like the library of tools, resources, etc. All together is a strength. Like we've got this pile of amazing stuff. We've got people who know how to sculpt with it.

Speaker D: Are you talking about tools or are.

Speaker A: You talking about your catalog?

Speaker E: I would just say catalog as part of it. As the tools are part of the catalog. Diverse product and deep tech tools.

Speaker A: Well, I was thinking about developmentals, you know, software development tools.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker A: Versus teaching and learning tools.

Speaker E: I'm thinking of teaching and learning tools as building blocks for.

Speaker A: So I'm going to call that all catalog.

Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. Catalog is fair.

Speaker A: Which we didn't really have on here.

Speaker B: I don't. Well, diverse products, deep tech tools, those are all now being.

Speaker E: Yeah, that's sort of a stand in for stuff.

Speaker C: So all our. Yes.

Speaker B: Just summarize.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker C: All right.

Speaker B: Three bullet points.

Speaker C: So those are three.

Speaker G: That's how creative we are.

Speaker E: Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker C: You have four.

Speaker F: We took 20\.

Speaker C: Does the diverse product, does that include the.

Speaker E: The model? I think so. All right.

Speaker C: So yeah, so basically, yeah, we are smart people.

Speaker B: So you can take the star off of modeling.

Speaker E: Modeling because that's also people with good stuff who are nimble.

Speaker A: Okay, but three is not hard and fast.

Speaker E: But yeah, it's fine.

Speaker B: So the top one and the bottom one, we said we were combining.

Speaker E: No, I don't think so.

Speaker B: Nimble.

Speaker E: I don't think so. I think they're different.

Speaker G: There was an argument for wine. Nimble was different than a team of.

Speaker E: Somebody tell me smart people who can only do the same thing are different than smart people who can do something new.

Speaker B: I guess I. No.

Speaker D: Okay, whatever.

Speaker C: For good enough, let's go to the next.

Speaker B: Opportunity.

Speaker C: So opportunity. Earth science.

Speaker E: So right. So like if you were to look at the world of stuff like like of. Of opportunity opportunities in general. Like Earth science is just another one. But if you look at it together with our strengths, Earth science is. Gets a star because like that's an opportunity space that we are uniquely suited for.

Speaker A: What if we were to change this.

Speaker E: On a subject slash crew them. Okay, that says own own.

Speaker G: Like basically like we are the people that people that others go to for that particular like fed is for the.

Speaker D: Physics models and Concord is for the earth science model.

Speaker B: Can I ask a question about opportunity? So is the orientation of opportunities opportunity to make money? Is that the what we're starring Impact slash money?

Speaker E: Yeah. Yes.

Speaker B: Okay. I would say wraparound services then would be. Yeah, wraparound our biggest opportunity, especially our short term.

Speaker C: I think that would be.

Speaker D: I think that's wraparound services. Like people oriented things like we're giving pd, we're helping people out and LTI integration is like well you can. Other people can. Can use our stuff because integrated into the system.

Speaker B: Well we might be able to charge for if you want it integrated to your system. Like you want our catalog to show up for the teacher in your lms.

Speaker D: Oh thank you.

Speaker B: A mini STEM resource finder in your lms. We could potentially charge for that.

Speaker E: Oh I like that like extensions are built on build ons from what we have.

Speaker D: Stuff on learn if for free. But it's not going to be integrated into your system. But you want it integrated into your system.

Speaker E: And I've talked to folks who helped do open source sort of sustainability who mentioned that you know, curriculum providers now when they go to districts nowadays districts are like we like that load it into our curriculum please and make sure into our LMS please. And like that's just expected now. And so they were saying like you could also load in the you know, expansion pack, the Concord expansion pack which is every year subscription and then you can pull away if you want because you've got control. So like that's come up a few different times.

Speaker D: And we can also sell them teacher professional.

Speaker E: That's right.

Speaker D: We should do that.

Speaker G: I would make an argument for branding and it's not up there but like visibility. I think there's a lot of. I think there's a lot of opportunity in that arena that we have not tapped into.

Speaker E: Yeah, I might save my star and put that on weaknesses. But yes, same thing. Good. So are we starring on a subject curriculum Earth science.

Speaker D: But like that could be the thing we start with. Like that's a nice way. Like something has to be the first thing that goes right?

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker D: So the Earth Science things are unique. There's a lot of biology in this world. There's a lot of other things, but not earth science.

Speaker A: But take it higher, take it a level higher. Regardless of which subject, how important is it to develop a curriculum?

Speaker E: At least one for us to develop. I, I mean it is important to have one and to be in part of one. To have scale and impact. I don't know that for. What's that? Yeah, I don't think that we can. Well, it's possible as well, right? I don't know that we, we can't develop open science. Yes, exactly.

Speaker F: That's true for earth science.

Speaker E: But no. Well, I mean we can, we can make our version of open science, for example or illustrative math or what have you.

Speaker B: So there are a few open curricular.

Speaker D: Yeah, but then how do you make them pay for something that's also open source?

Speaker E: That's the part I'm still stuck because it's enhanced with our something.

Speaker H: But even if it wasn't existing and say we do Earth science now, we got to convince a teacher to pay us to replace their whole curriculum with our curriculum.

Speaker E: Well, so own a curriculum. That's what I'm questioning. Own a subject. It doesn't necessarily mean that we are the publishers. It might mean that we are the. We cornered the market in some way, shape or form with somebody else, with something else, whatever. So I think there might be a couple. So data science ed is similar but not quite the same. But like having a. We could corner the market on the tool for data science ed, for example. Corner the market on Earth science. There are a couple places where you could do that. Biology curriculum. No. How can I do it?

Speaker D: But we kind of already have.

Speaker E: Well, genetics.

Speaker G: Yes, genetics.

Speaker E: But unfortunately we corner. Does two weeks.

Speaker G: Yeah, it's a two week part of what a biology teacher is asked to teach in a year.

Speaker B: Yeah, we don't have up there the data science thing. I mean if you ask me, of all the products, products that we have here, Concord, that's the most saleable or potentially salable. I would say Kodak falls into that category. Yeah, we've had exponential growth for 10 years. The last 12 months we had 840,000 unique users. And it's the exponential growth has continued. And that's just through word of mouth. So I think if we had a big, a bigger picture push or some kind of sales thing or talk to large districts or something. Yeah, we can sell wraparound service.

Speaker E: If you're looking at our stuff. Right. The Earth science suite and CODAP are sort of, I think the two things that are most closely product ish and I don't know what opportunities they like they are the foundation of some opportunities, what the opportunities look like. Is it a curriculum? Is this something. Is it. Is it, you know, sort of wraparound? I don't think we know that and that well.

Speaker A: But that could be the focal points for a deeper dive with middle school teachers on those subjects.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker A: Which I think is a crying need is to be able to get that kind of focus.

Speaker B: We do have the Interactions curriculum, which is a full year course. I would say if we modernized it in certain ways with an AI component to it, we, you know, or even something that might be AI oriented that works with all of our, you know, activity player things that can manage to deal with, you know, open response questions and constructed student responses like drawings of models and things like that, then that will would be an interesting. It'd be even more interesting than it currently is. It's already, already used by some. I had somebody yesterday said we're adopting Interactions for, you know, the such and such. They're doing it for like credit recovery course, which is interesting. But they're adopting. They're like, do you have other resources? For me, that came yesterday. Right. And it's a very old curriculum. But, you know, that's why I say I want to modernize it. But it could be other, like a foundation for something that we could put out as a full year.

Speaker A: Is that our third star?

Speaker E: Not sure.

Speaker C: It's sounding like we're trying to circle around something that would be unique to what's out there. Right. You know, as, as the place for the opportunity to see whether we can get recognition for it.

Speaker A: Not necessarily unique. I mean, if you can build a better mousetrap, there's nothing wrong with that as a way forward. But based on your.

Speaker C: But what I'm hearing is the Kodap, you know, idea is that, you know, this is an opportunity because A, it's. There's some recognition, B, there's got a capacity for it that we don't have the competition for, if you will.

Speaker E: Right. I mean, there are opportunity. There are opportunity spaces that Earth, the Earth Science Suite, codap, a few other things could enable us to work in. I don't think that, you know, I don't. That's why I was saying I think Kodap is an opportunity. It's a thing. It might be a key that unlocks some. And Neuroscience Suite too is not really. It's like there's something to be done with that potentially. And we haven't mentioned clue as a platform. That's another example of something that is a key that could unlock a couple different opportunity spaces. Right? Yeah.

Speaker A: And let me be clear here also. I mean, we're talking about this as immediate priorities. If we were to run with this and develop a more fleshed out curriculum informed by market feedback, that basically just sets the model for expanding or re expanding into the other disciplines where you already have presence.

Speaker E: But do we really want to do that?

Speaker D: Like, it would take a really long time. We don't know how to do it. We have a very short Runway. Teachers use have already bought curriculums that are approved by their districts. We're not going to get shit approved by anybody's district in the amount of time before Concord's over.

Speaker E: So, so.

Speaker D: But what we do have are things that people can plug in and all of the teachers, no matter what curriculum they have selected are doing like, I'm doing this thing and I'm gonna go do that thing. Like those are the things we need to add so that our stuff is like the fun supplemental stuff to the boring Pearson thing that they're, you know.

Speaker E: I mean, that's all fair. And that's another star, I think is that bubble right there.

Speaker D: We have the fun things to like make your. What you already have bought and what your. What your schools are.

Speaker F: Okay, so an opportunity. You want to flip phrase it this way? An opportunity that we have is creating those mappings.

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker F: That say if you use this book here, you know, this thing is starred, this thing is started, this thing is started, this thing is starred. And here's the URL that you need to go to.

Speaker G: Yeah. It's almost like, I mean, it's similar to the state criteria thing. It's like you could map to NGSS alignment, you could map to state criteria.

Speaker A: It also had some ramifications for curriculum. It's kind of borrowing before if you, if there's a standard curriculum or a standard textbook and you're showing where you've been.

Speaker E: Right? Yeah, yeah. Concord inside is my imagining that like intel's like I've, you know, that that was, that's what one opportunity space. That is significant. Right? Exactly. But what opens. I already. Openside has already done it. Right. I mean Openside is, you know, if you took Concord away from Openside, it would be significant holes in that curriculum right now. It would. We would hope that it was more Swiss cheese than it would be, but it's encouraged them. Well, right.

Speaker F: But they don't make any money?

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker D: Again with the no money.

Speaker F: They also make no money. Let me see.

Speaker B: Right. They don't make any money, but a lot of people are making money around it. Doing professional development.

Speaker F: Yes.

Speaker B: And things like that.

Speaker C: Which is what we're talking about too.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker D: Making money around someone else's.

Speaker G: Yeah. That kind of falls into wraparound services.

Speaker D: Yes.

Speaker E: Yeah. So they're up. So we're definitely homing in on opportunity spaces. And I don't know that we know the thing, but I don't know that that's we're expected to yet either. I mean, like, I want to know what if there is an opportunity space in Earth science middle school, something. And the answer might be yes, it might be no, it might be. We wish there was. But reality, I don't know.

Speaker H: But I mean the other way to look at this sort of specialization, data science or earth science is not supposed. So much that we're providing curriculum is that we're making it easier for people to understand us by saying, okay, they are good at data science and they're good at earth science. If I think those, I'm going to go to Concord. And so then it's good for us to have enough there that they can find what they need for those particular topics. It's not like we're trying to sell them all curriculum, it's just that we're trying to have enough to make it worthwhile to come back.

Speaker A: And this all ties in up here. Also branding, how do you reposition your. What message do you want to have? Do you want to communicate consistently across all your different segments?

Speaker E: So to some degree, if there were multiple walls within it, cornering the mind share on a space might be enough. Like arguably like part of the reason that we are still X billion dollars is because, you know, Earth science, data science, like things have come to us because we are the go tos for some of those things. Data science like Valhalla came to us because everybody said why don't you talk to Concord? And so there's some level within that. Now you can't build a business just on that unless you're McKinsey. But you know, having it is more than just branding. It's a gravitational attraction.

Speaker A: That's the most positive thing that I see with you guys is you have a track record that is already impressive. You have things you can point to, you have some leverage. It's a matter of flipping that into marketability and revenue. It's not like we're starting from scratch and having to break through from Nothing. So just to.

Speaker B: We've made a little progress. I used to go to conferences and talk about the conquering social people were like, who?

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker B: And now I would say at any teacher oriented conference, if it's not a majority, a good number of people already have heard of us, know who we are, definitely have. So we have some brand identity at that level. But I don't, I think it's still like, oh yeah, they make some cool.

Speaker E: No, it goes beyond that too. I mean, there are multiple commercial opportunities that we've either explored or been involved in where some of the people have come to us because their representatives were teachers that, you know, used Concord stuff and then got into publishing or what have you. So it's, you know, there's stuff to.

Speaker G: Be said, but it feels like maybe two is okay in this category. Just it sounds like everything we're talking about either comes back to something else we can do that we can get people to pay us for or some way of making ourselves branded and known in a certain area.

Speaker F: I am very surprised that no one is going. No one is fighting on the AI tech leverage.

Speaker E: Well, that's another piece that feels to me like it's underneath this all. I mean, I think that there's an opportunity for us to figure out what AI can do uniquely for our product line or our ingenuity or something. I don't know that my first thing is like, we need to go compete in the AI space. But we should be able to be so clever with our tools, with AI that we could surprise people.

Speaker B: I think the right, I think the way for me, the rationality for asterisking that is that this is what people want to fund right now. So if we're not going to go after that opportunity and we're going to do all the other stuff around it and not make any advances in AI in our tech catalog, then that we're.

Speaker E: Going to have a problem. Not saying AI is a threat. Yeah, okay, you got.

Speaker A: No, but you have to, you'll have to make some decisions across all this because you're not going to be.

Speaker D: If we're putting our interactive things into other people's stuff. The people who, first of all, they don't know how to use it unless they pay us to do stuff. But we're putting, we're putting this interactive cool stuff into their already boring things now. Awesome. How do they grade that? They don't know how to grade it because one, they don't know how to use it. But if we had AI that graded it and put it into their lti, magical, whatever system they need, then that is where we use AI, Right? We use AI to like do assessments of our cool things. So not only are we providing the cool thing, the training on the cool thing, but also like assessing your students use of the cool thing. Because otherwise it is just quizlets and they know the kid got 10 out of 12 when he just does them until he gets them all, right, he has no learning, none.

Speaker C: Right?

Speaker D: So but like, if it actually was watching him do an interactive and spit out some sort of AI, like the thing, like even with the two wells, they didn't put it in the aqua part, like that is actually useful.

Speaker C: Right? So, so the reason why I, I, I don't understand sort of, you know, Dan's like, oh, you know, this is where the funding is, is AI. I'm like, and everybody's there. Are there places that climb climate change is still being funded or whatever, like, you know, like that, that we're not therefore competing with everybody, you know, like that. That's, it's always an interesting question of if, if you're, you know, swimming with absolutely everybody else, it's hard to know that you're the redfish when everybody's a blue fish.

Speaker F: Right?

Speaker C: You know, whatever.

Speaker E: Right. I mean, the advantage is it's not, but doesn't have to be either or. I mean, we can print a brochure that doesn't say AI and brochure that doesn't say AI on it next to the same sentence.

Speaker C: So the prioritizing of like the energy of where the developers are going to be or whatever, like what we're going to be doing. And it's not that I, it's yes or no. I just have always been intrigued by, you know, that balance between if everybody's there, is that the right place for us to be?

Speaker G: Right. And I think also it brings up an important question of like, yeah, okay, the funding is in AI, but like where, who's funding it?

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker G: The buzzword has been, you know, the government is interested in funding AI, but like we're not seeing anything. They didn't cancel certain words that you said. But like, you know, to be clear.

Speaker E: Like for at least a couple years, foundations, you know, are going to be funding whatever funding AI means. Like they're very, they're very interested. Everybody's funding AI is right. And, and nsf, to the extent that it's there and it will still be there, is also going to be leaning heavily in that direction. So we do need to recognize that.

Speaker D: That'S all the things that Amy wants to do.

Speaker E: Well, we should ask that too.

Speaker C: I also have though, is my understanding is, and this is the large language models, are there effing expensive to, to run like.

Speaker E: No, they're not.

Speaker F: Any starting to be better answers for that?

Speaker E: Yeah, no, that's, that's not the barrier.

Speaker C: Really, because like the, all the big open AI companies or whatever, they're like.

Speaker G: In billions because they have billions of users. We don't.

Speaker C: Well, we have to shut down Hasbot because it was $12\.

Speaker G: But it was built how many years ago.

Speaker D: If it was 1200 or 12,000, it's still.

Speaker F: All right, I don't want to have this.

Speaker E: We're not doing there. I don't want to have this.

Speaker G: No, no.

Speaker E: But the cost is not the issue.

Speaker D: But I think that it's an important point. Like, are there foundations that still care about the things that everyone used to care about before Trump?

Speaker E: That question is worth asking and we should find that out at the same time. And I, I definitely think we should be looking at climate change funding and I don't think it's mutually exclusive. Like, we, I don't think we should be saying just because everybody's an AI, we're going to be all in on the five climate change funders in the world.

Speaker C: But we've got limit, we've got really limited internal resources, so we're going to have to choose one or the other.

Speaker A: Well, you're going to have to get funding one way or another, and you're going to have to, in my opinion, be very clear on what you're bringing to those funders. And that's, that's where this kind of thing comes in, especially part two when we're sitting down with instructors, especially, you know, as, with teachers, as segmented as we can, you know, as specialized as we can.

Speaker B: One thing, so one thing I don't, I would say competitive advantage, too.

Speaker A: Sorry to interrupt you because you'll be going into these funders saying these teachers from rural schools are telling us xyz and we have the expertise, expertise just to know what kind of solution that is. Because the, the teachers, they, they'll think quizlet. They'll think stuff that they already have. You guys add the extra value. Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker B: That's fine. I mean, the one thing about AI that I don't know yet from teachers. So the thing, the at least couple of directions that I wanted to go have both involved, I would say first of all, AI is making possible things I've wanted to do for years. It's not like I'm suddenly saying, oh, AI is available. What can I do with it? There's been stuff that I've been wanting to do for a long time, and the AI piece is now making it possible. The other thing is I. I've been out of the classroom long enough that I'm not sure that I know what teachers wish AI could do for them. And I, you know, like, part of what I want to do do is I want to make AI things that adapt to the teacher's own style of teaching or doing things. So, like, not grading it for them necessarily, but saying, here's how you might grade this, or you can put in your own feedback and it starts to adapt to the way they would like, what are the things they pay attention to, ways that they want to give feedback to students. I haven't seen any tools like that. Well, sure, I'm not going to argue whether we should do one or the other. I'm just saying. Saying that I don't know whether a teacher would prefer that it just grades it for me or I wanted to grade it in the way I want to grade it.

Speaker E: Yeah. And I think all that goes to the answer, which is just like, it's not technology for technology's sake. It's not AI for AI sake. It's like there are very, well, things within climate Earth science that we want to do that AI could make this better. If we can do that and surprise people with it, and then we can say AI at the same time as we're also saying Earth Science, then we get the better of both worlds. Now, yes. Limited resources and time. Totally with you on that.

Speaker B: But I also see AI it's sort of like when personal computers became available. School's like, we gotta get computers in all the classrooms. And they had no idea what to do with them. You know, they're like bricks sitting on people's desk half the time. And, you know, we're like, we know what to do. I feel like it's similar now. It's like there's this bay we got to figure out what we're going to do with AI and there's this big push to get it at least into companies. I don't know how much the push is to get it into schools at this point, but it seems like it's this technology that everyone feels like they have to start using, even if they don't know how to use it yet because. Because the students are right. The students are using it. I'm going to be left behind if I don't know how to use this kind of thing. And I feel like, again, we're in this position where we can say, well, we have ideas about how to make it, you know, the same way we have ideas how to make this computer useful in the classroom, we have ideas about how to make the AI component useful.

Speaker A: I'm really psyched about the prospect of combining your vision with what we hear from teachers. Again, in my experience, the market teachers, professors, whomever, don't understand much beyond what's right in front of them. And that's not a criticism. That just seems to be the way that when we. I told a story, but I'll tell again. When we first were rolling out adaptive learning time and time again, we'd start 30 seconds in and everybody's eyes would glaze over.

Speaker B: Oh, this is.

Speaker A: Flashcards is the phrase I was writing. This is just flashcards. Flashcards. And then we learned to kind of leverage that. And so we set up these demonstrations such that they'd see the change within 30, they'd see the system adapt to the input that it was getting. And I had a professor sitting right here next to me in a focus group who was a psychologist, specialize in learning at Southern Mississippi University, who saw this and turned to me and said, this is a bfd mind blown. He became one of our strongest advocates. The point is nobody else in the room understood what was being presented. And that's where I think that's the thing that excites me most about what concrete has to offer. Informed buying. And then going back and using the same language those guys, those professors were lo using in the room to go tell the rest of the world about what we're trying to do.

Speaker E: Right now when they're saying use AI, they might as well have been saying use computers. They're really good as a doorstop or a whole. Like, we're like know. Powered by AI is I think, what we're trying to.

Speaker C: Well, I still don't understand it. I mean, what you all thinking and.

Speaker E: And well, we need to. There's an opportunity space for us to figure out what that is, what powered by AI means for us and.

Speaker C: And what that means for education. Yes, I agree.

Speaker A: Would mapping be a third or is that considered part of wraparound?

Speaker E: What's mapping? I think mapping is just crosswalk. Crosswalk. I think that's a. I think that's a tactic.

Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, under opportunities, there's opportunities to spread our work. And that's not necessarily a money thing.

Speaker A: What do you mean by that?

Speaker B: Well, so there are obstacles to being able to be used, whether it's for free or for money or whatever, whatever just being used at all. Like we're not going to get, we're not going to get huge adoption into big districts that require LTI integration. It doesn't matter whether we have our free stuff and people love it. It doesn't matter. LUSC is paying tens of thousands of dollars to print something that they want for their teachers to use because they won't, because we don't do LTI integration. I mean it's ridiculous.

Speaker F: Fix that for you.

Speaker D: It sounds like that's a huge key.

Speaker E: To this whole thing.

Speaker B: I've had some teachers in that district, they're like, I'll rebuild your curriculum in our schoology thing. And they built some of the units that they, their favorite units. They rebuilt them, you know, volunteer wise because they wanted them in the system.

Speaker E: Well, that's, that's a, I mean that's a BFD signal. Right? So I mean when you're looking at products and things, you're looking for those kinds of things where like people want the things so much that they're climbing over whatever or like they're making their own solutions. So like we need to be listening for those.

Speaker B: And that's a big, I would say obstacles are the mapping, the LTI integration, onboarding for the kinds of things that we, that are more complex for people to be able to pick up and get really excited about. Those are all kinds of like how do we disseminate broadly and if we become popular, the more popular we are, the more likely we are to cut some licensing deals with publishers and things like that. So even without the actual revenue, the ability to spread more broadly, more easily is an important part of the money making thing later.

Speaker E: Removing barriers. Right?

Speaker G: I mean I think that's when I say visibility, that's part visibility dissemination. Right. It's like getting ourselves out there and being a name and having professional looking products that are respected and people are excited about music.

Speaker A: Do you guys present at conferences at all?

Speaker E: You know, we present.

Speaker C: We used to, we used to.

Speaker B: I have none of even a year ago.

Speaker E: We go to virtual ones, we go to real ones.

Speaker A: Get those names. If that's not obvious.

Speaker E: Yeah, we go to teacher ones and.

Speaker D: We go to researcher ones which are probably less helpful.

Speaker E: Do you think, Leslie, do you think that platform, that clue as a platform object is an opportunity space or not? Am I pumping that up in my mind as something that is differentiable enough?

Speaker F: No, I Absolutely do. When people get there, like really get there, and I'm with Amy, there's a barrier there that we need to figure out.

Speaker A: Out.

Speaker F: But when they really get there, it is distinct. It provides opportunities for collaboration which interests me most, honestly, because I see all these references to absenteeism being a big problem for teachers and I don't know if it's legit, but I theorize that if the kid can participate in group work with their peers but at home, you will ameliorate that problem. Right. And I think that that is a big deal. I think the ways in which we are integrating AI into that technology and returning what amounts to an evaluation of the students work that the teacher can then use to summarize. Because they all want to do this. Right. They want to do those gallery walks. They want to do this. Okay, metacognitive. What have we learned in the last week? Let's sit back and talk about it. And it helps them curate a set of examples ready made so they don't have to spend their whole evening, the night before fishing through all that student work. You enable much more open ended work that doesn't have to be captured in a multiple choice answer because we have bridged that gap. There's huge potential there. I have trouble saying that.

Speaker E: Yeah, I think we're, I think there's an opportunity for a flashcard moment somehow in boiling Clue down to its bare essence in some way.

Speaker F: Yes, I believe it do. I think it is the first thing that we should go after.

Speaker E: I'm not sure I am disagreeing. Yeah.

Speaker D: Those challenges.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker F: You know, I would love to see us use some of the stuff that we know people are clamoring for and then say, okay, now that we're back on steady feet and we believe that we can employ our staff even reduced as it is for, you know, three years instead of one or whatever. Now let's look at the thing that's going to help us to survive for the next 10 and I, I think that that might be it, but I'm scared to put that out front.

Speaker E: Right. Yeah, it's definitely a complicated story, but.

Speaker A: That'S also what you can test a little bit.

Speaker E: Teachers, whether clues is a thing enough.

Speaker D: What if we can get our stuff into other people's things with this LTI thing?

Speaker E: Then that's something that we can try. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And that's the sort of thing you can try quickly. Yeah. Right. Thank you. And there are other.

Speaker G: We love you, Dan. There are others.

Speaker E: There are other signals that we should be Paying attention to. I mean, I think that signal from LAUSD about people building is one. I think the. You know, there are things when we talk to people that we've heard over and over again. One example that comes to mind for me is I've heard independently multiple different people when we were talking about codap, point to the dashboard that they see in the DESMOS curriculum learning, where you see all the class at once. And there's like, oh, if you just had that, then I could see where all my students were. And unprompted. I can think of like five instances across the three different conversations or user interviews or groups where that came up. So, like, those are some signals like that to me goes, ding, ding, ding. Wraparound, freemium. Some version of like, okay, that plus integrates with your sis. Ltis. Like, there could be a thing there that might not be complicated to develop. You know, LTI may be not complicated way to get, you know, interactions into. Who knows? So that's. Listening to some of those signals might help us.

Speaker F: You know, at the same time that I'm not, like, not totally sold on the idea of putting Clue out there first. I'm not blind to the fact that we already have a lot of those.

Speaker E: Right, Exactly.

Speaker F: I have an instant view dashboard. I have a sharing system. And we could try a lot of experiments if we wrote a script and say, suck the interaction curriculum.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker F: And published it that way.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker D: Do they really have dashboard thingies like in these lms?

Speaker E: No, not the way we're talking about.

Speaker B: For a long time, the computer lab model at schools, there was the thing where you could monitor everybody.

Speaker E: Not now. No. And when they do have dashboards disappeared.

Speaker B: If that was such an important feature.

Speaker E: Yeah, well, the people weren't using sophisticated enough technology. Technology materials to want it. And now that they are through things like amplify or they want it just to keep.

Speaker B: Make sure the kids aren't playing.

Speaker E: That was what it was there.

Speaker C: Right. One of the things that we suffer from is, like, the teachers all like, I love that, I love that, I love that. And then it's way too much.

Speaker E: Yeah, well, and that's why I'm saying, like, this one is unprompted. Like, this example I'm talking about is unprompted. Dan's. You know, people loading interactions into there is unprompted. Those are the cases where you're like, oh, people are looking for this thing that we didn't even know they wanted. And lots of things come this way. Slack was the communication system from a game that was supposed to be amazing. And the game sputtered and they realized that they'd been trying to build this with this and they're like, this is awesome. This is a thing. I mean, there are multiple. Flipgrid was like became, I don't know why amazing. But it was not intended to be what it was. It just was the sort of exhaust from another project. So those things can happen.

Speaker D: So maybe would building a dashboard for these things might be the thing that we could make.

Speaker E: Well, I'm just saying, like we should be listening. We should try to amplify that signal when we're hearing it from somebody and try to see if there's a thing there. And it may be that some of those past experiments, like you could, like it would take us a week to boil down Clue, you know, to its components by shutting off some switches and doing something and making the flashcard activity in a sprint and calling up some teachers and seeing if, like, if they're completely non plus, then completely forget. If all 10 of them are on the floor, then all right, maybe there's a thing there. So there may be a few of those kinds of things.

Speaker A: And I would suggest that that should be informed by sticking to a particular topic area or two.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker A: Or else you're going to get the mission creep again.

Speaker D: I feel like that is a good point of like sticking with something small because like if we just give out these big tools that people don't know how to use, there are people who are awesome, like early adopters who can make codon do amazing things and do all these things. But 90% of teachers want to show earthquakes in their unit and like a cross section and watch that, it's a descending plate. So those are the, that's where we could start.

Speaker F: You know, again, don't undervalue like the guide.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker F: If you know what the top two seventh grade science textbooks are, that ought to be a thing we could point out. And you could develop a two page link, two page link list.

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker F: When you're teaching this, show this. When you're teaching this, show this and move across the concrete catalog. Right. It's a piece on paper. It would take you a week to research. Like you should do that now.

Speaker B: I think that would be a quick way. So one of the things that we still have been focused like in a, in a subject area. I do think the CODAP thing is a little bit different in the sense that it's basically a data tool. And anywhere where someone uses a spreadsheet now, they're probably Better off using CODAP in their classes. I would say, if you don't find it hard to use right now, but you need to sit with me for 20 minutes. I think we'll teach a word. But, you know, I think, you know, it's the kind of thing where. So I've been doing a lot of interviews with students for one of my projects. Now we're looking at codap as, you know, we're testing something specific within it, but, you know, some percentage of the students, you know, spontaneously ask us, can we use this outside of here? And then I say, have you. You know, how does this compare with what you usually do in spreadsheets? They're like, this is so much easier. Like, this is. It's definitely in. When I've done workshops with teachers, I mean, there are always sort of like, audible gasps, like it just. Right. So it happens at every single workshop I do with new teachers. So. And I'm sure there's some people who, you know, are probably still finding it overwhelming, but there's enough where, you know, the word of mouth.

Speaker E: I've been in these conversations many, many times, and we have. I was in the conversations 10 years ago yelling about onboarding for Kodap, and we never did it. And we've failed ourselves all the way across the board. But the 20 minutes is striking, and 60, 70 user conversations is striking. How many people consistently, you know, we'll say, it's like, it's really amazing. And we are cutting ourselves off at the knees every time we give you that blank state with nothing to help you. Massively. Massively.

Speaker B: The point. I brought it up for us because it's a. It's a different thing to say. We have a general tool that you could use across various curriculum.

Speaker E: Right. Yeah. I don't know where.

Speaker B: Right. Versus we want to build an Earth science curriculum. Yeah, Those are just two different.

Speaker E: But they're both. They're both meaningful opportunities.

Speaker D: But two things we could start with in this LTI integration, we can do one open tool and one set of smaller things.

Speaker E: Well, and those aren't mutually exclusive either.

Speaker B: Get us the entire STEM Resource Finder catalog.

Speaker E: Well, LTI integration doubled down on Earth science would help us understand different places to move our science. LTI integration for CODAP would help us understand how to grade your students in this mysterious, crazy data tool thing. Like, so there's, you know, combinations.

Speaker D: We only have certain amount of people that can, like, get this going. So, like, we have to pick a couple things.

Speaker E: Well, I'm just saying, like, there's a little band in it.

Speaker C: But. And that's the question where we started, which is where Leslie's like, so I'm surprised nobody's saying AI right. And, and you know, like that that's a third place of putting brain space.

Speaker E: Well, and in my view there's like, like some of these things are quick ish wins and like the LTI integration plus anything is like, let's just go with that. And from now we can start doing that right away. And some of the code app stuff, like we can just go with some maybe a little bit. I think the reason we're not saying that for AI is that like it's, it's clear that there is like massive importance in it and the path is not clear. So to me it feels like there's a, there's a center lane of us going, yeah, like what about AI? Like what's the real essence? And like doing some thinking and working in something. And like that's a. Maybe that's a six month.

Speaker G: I was gonna say in the same way that we're doing market research for what the teachers want, is there like an avenue to do market research on what private foundations want, want to see as far as up and coming AI projects, tools, they may not know what.

Speaker A: They want other than that. I mean they're going to want what the teachers tell.

Speaker E: Yeah, well, and I think, I think those are all the same part of what I'm saying that long, that longer middle center is it's driven by what the teachers are not telling us that they want and need, but are expressing it underneath it. No, but they know what they, what they won't know. They know what they need in their life. Like they'll know what their pain points. Yeah, their pain points.

Speaker A: They'll know what their pain points and their hurdles and their obstacles are.

Speaker E: Exactly.

Speaker A: And then it's up to you guys and the vision that you have to go beyond what they currently have available to them. That's the exciting part.

Speaker E: Yeah. If we can listen to that and say AI could also help with that. And we have LTI integration already. So LTI integration plus AI magic growing underneath. Right? Yeah.

Speaker B: I mean I think the AI basically we're not going to stop writing grants or going to foundations for funding. And my guess is the AI thing is going to be one of those places where we have more opportunities. So at some level that's going to happen regardless of what we choose to do here. But it's more long term. Right? I guess we're trying to figure out what are the shorter term things that we could do within a six month or less time period? Yeah, that would be the idea.

Speaker E: Yep. Yeah.

Speaker G: And have something.

Speaker B: So that's why I think the AI thing was. Wasn't sort of initially started, at least in my head. I'm sort of like, okay, that's our long term thing. If we can keep going as an organization, we'll do some cool AI things.

Speaker A: Allowing for the possibility that we may hear something when we're listening to the teachers and you'll think, oh, this aligns with what I've always wanted to do until, like had. Which I couldn't do until I had.

Speaker B: AI was to still need funding to do it.

Speaker A: But that's when you can go to the funders and say, we heard some teachers told us.

Speaker B: Right. Well, I'm still planning to do that.

Speaker D: If we get the island project, that is one thing we're trying to do, and Jay's project, we should be the.

Speaker A: Kicker to do that.

Speaker E: Yeah. Well, that's the other piece of that in that middle core is we do have funding for projects. Right. And so part of what I keep on reminding us is that we have control over how we use that funding. So, like, if that island project comes in like the. I don't care what the first year of that grant says. Whatever we're what. What we need to do is figure out this middle car and youthquake and something and DST and whatever. Like all that goes to doing this thing.

Speaker C: That's his son you're dealing with.

Speaker E: I don't care. I'm. I don't care because it's a five year grant and I would like to see the fifth year of that grant. And unless we figure out the first year aligned toward all this crap, we're not going to get there.

Speaker C: So I get you.

Speaker E: We have done more five year, three year projects that have figured out what they're doing in the year 2\.7 of 3\. Yes.

Speaker A: To kind of bring this all. We've already talked about this, but. And it sounds like LTI integration is one of the quick wins. Is there anything else here that represents a potential quick win?

Speaker B: That mapping is.

Speaker C: The mapping.

Speaker E: Yeah, the mapping. I agree.

Speaker G: Yeah, we could do that.

Speaker H: And AI can help with that.

Speaker D: Isn't that what the STEM resource binder.

Speaker E: Was supposed to do?

Speaker G: No, the ngss.

Speaker E: The NGSS thing was sort of that. Which helped people a little bit too. But it's not a curriculum. Yeah, that. No, not in. That existed before Crayfield existed.

Speaker C: So I was also going to Say that anybody can mention gss, but you know, to be much more specific with the products.

Speaker E: Well, and that's. And that's the pain point. Friday I'm on page 16, right?

Speaker C: Exactly.

Speaker E: I need to something because I can't publishing.

Speaker C: You'd have a barcode to go to a CD ROM or something. I don't know.

Speaker E: There are barcodes that exist. They just happen to be square now. Right. So there's no reason you can't be doing that. Right.

Speaker A: Pasted in the background.

Speaker C: I was back with those big discs.

Speaker E: Oh yeah, the laser light. Right.

Speaker C: That was the D.C. heath. That's what we were doing. Like, oh, it was so exciting.

Speaker E: There's a reason that our thing in our newsletter had been called Monday's lesson for a long time. Right. There's no reason why it's not like, what page are you on? Yeah, here's your savior. Monday morning, scan this text that they.

Speaker H: Can paste to us so we can match it with our stuff. Or are we really going to have to match page by page?

Speaker F: Now that sounds like an AI application.

Speaker H: That's why I'm asking.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker H: Because if they have it digitally, they can copy and paste it into. We can say, yeah, we've got these five things.

Speaker E: Are we talking about making money by providing this mapping to people or are.

Speaker D: We just doing another thing out of the goodness?

Speaker E: I think it's Kylie's visibility and our understanding user. I mean, I think it's a. It's a play to understand where people are and what they're doing. What was your thinking, Leslie?

Speaker F: I would probably give that. Like you could build that, right? Like you could build that tomorrow.

Speaker E: The mapping.

Speaker F: The mapping of.

Speaker G: Paste your text in and we'll show you all the things that you can use.

Speaker F: Finder filter.

Speaker B: Well, no, because we don't have enough tagging on the STEM resource.

Speaker F: As long as you insist people give you their contact information, I would be willing to give that away for free for a couple of months.

Speaker D: So wait, can you tell me what's the use case of this? Someone's going to paste in what they. What their lesson plan is and we are going to spit out a list of.

Speaker B: Here's some resources that you.

Speaker D: But we don't have that much stuff.

Speaker B: We have quite. We have hundreds of simulations, stuff that.

Speaker G: Hasn'T been updated in a long time.

Speaker D: You know, we have like a bazillion activities that are not like real, that like other people have made that are just in there that have been.

Speaker B: What?

Speaker E: Well, that's a different. There are mappings to be had of one type or another. Yeah.

Speaker G: In the portal that should show up in search results.

Speaker E: Are we going to hand out mappings.

Speaker G: To stuff that now we need someone on the support line helping the teachers.

Speaker F: Oh, now there is an interesting question.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker G: We are. There you go. You just opened up. If you want help, you pay us.

Speaker B: So one thing that I think will be important, figure it out that we need to do soon. Which is also related to what the work we're doing with Rick is in its under branding invisibility is modifying our website in a way that tells a better story about what our strengths are as opposed to, you know, we have these 20 projects going.

Speaker E: Right, Right.

Speaker A: Brandon was on my list.

Speaker E: Yes.

Speaker A: Not. Not necessarily soup to nuts, but to develop.

Speaker B: But that's a thing that's doable within a shortish period of time.

Speaker G: It's already underway to some extent is working with Rick on making small changes.

Speaker B: Yeah, those are small changes. But I'm talking about like.

Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that.

Speaker B: We have our big, like here's our, you know, our simulations and simulation and modeling.

Speaker C: Right. Is there is. Are there things that we should concretely be paying attention to for this rebrand idea? Because otherwise.

Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I mean so I completely agree. And I also think that there's a little bit of carton horse in fleshing out some of this opportunity space and understanding where things are. I mean the advantage is that your homepage can change 10 times in 10 days. So it's not, you know, mutually exclusive either. But even the mapping pieces, without stopping ourselves in the tracks by asking it the to what end Question that we're asking underneath the surface is really important there because like yeah, that's a tool and if we know to what end, then we know what we're doing with the names or the something or the three months versus six months versus forever.

Speaker B: We can make one and then put out on our email. Anyone using this curriculum, we want your opinion on such and such mapping things. And see if people go this is amazing. Yeah, it would greatly expand us using Concord stuff. Or they might say I already use.

Speaker E: Well, that's a tactic piece too. I mean it might be as simple as the to what end Answer is to the end of informing the LTI integration possibility, potential, whatever. I mean it's the first step we'd need if we were going to use LTI integration to sell our value proposition. So.

Speaker C: But I guess you know, the brand, you know, like I agree it's complicated in our, in our, in our vision of what we were. And what we want to be is now has to change. But there also is, you know, you can change it in 10 days, but you need like, to do that focus group to know, like, did we hit the mark or not? You know, that kind of. Of thing. And, and, and I feel like, you know, even just the name conquered, right? Like, it's because Oregon conquered Massachusetts. Like, ooh, yeah, that's, you know, Fed actually had like, the reason the letters were there kind of thing. And so, you know, what is it that would help us figure out this rebranding, which is not just sort of like evolutionary learning.

Speaker F: And come on.

Speaker E: It'S all these pieces. I mean, it's. I think it's listening to what we hear and when this opportunity space that's going to help us. Sorry, Kylie.

Speaker G: Yeah, no, I was just going to say, like, you see it all the time with companies.

Speaker C: Like, I don't.

Speaker G: Well, you see, I'm not saying the portal is our product, right? But for example, it could be the Learn Portal by Concord Consortium.

Speaker E: You know what I mean?

Speaker G: Like, Concord can still be the company's name, but now we are saying, like, here's our thing, right? And we made it. But this is our brand, this is our product. This is the thing we're advertising, selling, making visible.

Speaker C: Right?

Speaker G: Right. Like as, as the thing we're going after, right?

Speaker E: The.

Speaker G: The big change, right, Is like.

Speaker E: At.

Speaker B: The same time, I do want both of.

Speaker E: Both the things you're talking about are important, right.

Speaker B: At the same time. And maybe it's less important now than it was a year ago, but we, we have had people who did not want to work with us as partners because they felt their brand was lost.

Speaker E: In working with us. Right? That's, that's true.

Speaker B: Adding the extra Concord, I mean, so there's, I mean, it's probably a both and kind of thing. We do that kind of branding. And then when we have partnerships, we have to figure out a different way of having that landing page where everybody feels happy with, you know, the branding that's.

Speaker E: Or, or if we're making $2 million on something else, then we might lose some partnerships too. I mean, who knows, right?

Speaker G: We make decisions about the types of.

Speaker D: Because, you know, partnerships we have or.

Speaker G: The types of things. Things that we make that require that kind of agreement.

Speaker E: Right? I mean, people set the, Set the bar in different places. People don't complain. Complain about that with, you know, sri because they just deciding, right? So you don't ask that question.

Speaker B: Yeah, no, I understand. I'm just saying okay, so maybe we don't work with partners anymore and we license with publishers, you know, like, you know, university partners.

Speaker C: Well, right. And so, so I mean, even just. You're saying what you just did with, you know, the, the portal, like Hunker Consortium was like. Right. You know, as a. Opposed to like, we're not allowed to change anything, including the pump. Right. Like, you know, like that, like, I.

Speaker G: Mean, it could be like we are saying like, okay, here's. Or it's this, you know, curriculum mapping thing. And it's like now we have this really nice tool and it's like the concrete consortium becomes less of a focus and it's the, the thing. It's the thing that we are.

Speaker E: Yeah, well, and I'm selling. I mean, I'm hearing. And it's. I'm hearing that. To what end in what you're saying as, you know, making sure our brand is associated with the things that people are using more clearly as a way to raise our profile and open up opportunities that might get missed otherwise, people don't know who we are. And I'm hearing the storytelling piece as getting really clear on our story so that people can approach us better. They know how to dock with us because they know what our story is. Yeah. And both of those are true and distinct.

Speaker D: I mean, it'd be a huge announcement. Right. You could do like this new the Learn by Conquer consortium portal, whatever you want to call it and it now has, can integrate with all of your things. And it's like just a big marketing. We have a new skin. We have new actual words that show what it is.

Speaker B: And then can we get a better.

Speaker C: I will say by having the easy collection page of Here's a collection of things that hang together. It's easy to point people to, you know, like, so are there things also.

Speaker E: Well, and it should be two or two or.

Speaker A: I forget what the rule is. Two or three clicks from the entry.

Speaker B: To where you're going. The mapping could be a collection.

Speaker E: But the, the most, the most important part in all this is like, yeah, we could. And this is what you're saying too. Yeah, we could do a lot of things, but which things are we going to do? And any of those things need to be two or three clicks away from learning more about something that amplifies this. So like, if we're going to do that something with, you know, more branding, if we're going to do this with users right now, that needs to be like. Because we're going to learn more about a thing that you know, we can amplify in some way. Like not just like we got more fun for users. Like we. Three years from now we're going to do that.

Speaker D: Right. It's not like here's more fun for stuff for you.

Speaker E: Right. Yeah. These, like everything. These are focused on learning about.

Speaker A: Part of it comes back to the North Star discussion also because revolutionary learning. I get it.

Speaker D: So good.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker A: It's good for conquered. But it is meaningless to.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker D: To our science literature, democratic audience. They should know that this is the birthplace of the revolution.

Speaker A: That's not their highest priority. Priority when they're looking in here.

Speaker D: I know.

Speaker B: We'll change our.

Speaker C: I was going to say woke science.

Speaker B: Well, no, see, now we have a guy with a gun. Right. You know, suddenly Texas will be interested in.

Speaker A: Separate. That's a separate. But, you know, something. Something about, you know, promoting science literacy. There's got to be better wording than that. But you know, CONQUER Consortium, Science literacy, building science literacy. One shot at a time.

Speaker G: Musket.

Speaker E: Right. So.

Speaker A: That is. That's branding.

Speaker E: That.

Speaker A: That's branding targeted for your. Your audience as opposed to what you kind of want to tell them. Because it's clever and I get it. Another thing to think about, and I do think, you know, we were not for the fact that I have some distractions for the next few weeks. I'd be happy to help you with this. I may know people who can help you to kind of develop a marketing plan or a branding plan when, you know, eight easy steps or.

Speaker E: Or whatever.

Speaker A: But I'm sure just with this group, there are a few things that, yeah.

Speaker E: There are a lot of ways we can deal with that. And I'm less concerned about being able to do that than I am about either getting tied up too much in it or more like, again, the to what end question. Like, I think the general branding piece is pretty clear that we want to be clear on our story, et cetera. The audience piece is not necessarily clear. Like, it's not even quite clear even in any of these opportunity pieces that it's that important to the financial side of things that teachers know who we are. Like in the big scheme of things. Yeah. But like in several of these solutions, maybe it's secondarily important, like getting the LTI integration in a way that gets us money and gets us in front of people is good. And then making sure our logo is. There is a second. I'm not quite sure. So we could spend a lot of energy redoing the website perfectly and then not, you know, Getting money from it too. So both that.

Speaker D: I don't think we need to redo the conquer.org website. It's the learn website.

Speaker B: Sure, whatever. Yeah, I think we need to do. Redo conquer.org.

Speaker E: Yeah, we need to redo both.

Speaker D: We do, but, like, not at this moment. Like, not to get this.

Speaker B: If we want to get foundation.

Speaker E: Foundation funding. Storytelling is different story.

Speaker B: Yeah, we need a different story than what that.

Speaker E: Yep.

Speaker D: Okay. No, I understand what you're saying, but for right now to make this happen and, like, we need to focus on the website as much.

Speaker E: All right.

Speaker F: We've descended into the bickering.

Speaker E: This is good. So. So it feel. It feels like.

Speaker A: It'S the quick wins discussion, which. Which I think we've gotten into and we distracted a little bit. But, you know, it's the LTI integration. It's mapping with potential ramifications for AI. It. It is branding to whatever extent can reasonably be implemented. I think it's also the symposium, the meeting of teachers, the market, direct market feedback. I'm struggling not to use the word focus group, but symposium, meetup. Meetup. And what was that? Three or four things that have different components. I know. If that's the outgrowth of this, then I think we're making strides. I think we're a little bit premature from making even reasonably informed decisions about where and what to attach revenue to, pricing to. But we're taking steps in that direction. And I hope, Think, Hope, Hope business strategy that with the feedback from the marketplace, combined with the kind of vision that Dan was talking about earlier and Amy was talking about earlier, for what you bring, that's where we'll be able to determine value or get a better determination of value. And then we can talk about how best to start charging for products and services.

Speaker E: And it feels like one thing that's occurring to me is that when we're saying LTI integration, we're talking about a technical thing, but we're actually not talking about the thing we should be, which is what's the next step like right now, while we're doing that, we should also be. We should have a group of folks thinking about, like, once we have it, what do we do and what conversations we have? How do we do? Right. So that feels like, like an obvious sort of strand. It's like LTI integration into, like, to what end? And the mapping pieces may be a part of that, perhaps. And it feels like maybe the user piece is slightly, you know, for Shogun and German is pushed forward, I guess, in that it's like the user informing us about pain points. And then we kind of feel that we go back to some of these things, like what do we have that might address those? Could AI help that? And then maybe it's sprint weeks or something to sort of test it out.

Speaker A: Yeah, you're getting at exactly what I said at the very beginning, that that's a whole cart before the horse bit. I think this was. I'd like to think this was useful to start to prioritize, but that's the piece that we need to put in place and then come back and revisit and kind of lay this over what we hear from your customers.

Speaker H: And I think that even applies to LTI because. Because there's a lot of things we can do with lti.

Speaker B: Oversimplify.

Speaker E: LTI means I've got a car. What do I do?

Speaker A: You know, another question we went back and forth on this in the meeting we had the other day is how granular do we want to get with the instructors? I don't know if that ship has sailed. If we already have, you know, a group coming together for that, we're going.

Speaker E: To have what we have for that one.

Speaker F: So, okay, we'll make be that unfortunately, can't be that cheesy at this.

Speaker A: That seems to be where we were headed, which we can work with.

Speaker G: So right now we have a new response.

Speaker F: As of yesterday, I'm convinced we can get.

Speaker E: Yeah, I'm sure we'll get to 10\.

Speaker A: Great.

Speaker F: Convinced we can get to 10\.

Speaker B: We're on.

Speaker E: One question that I think would be worth your having in the back of your head, Mike, is some of these, you know, other starred things that we're thinking are places to go when we're formed by users are also potentially places where we could be having lots of remote user calls at the same time, which is not the same as a symposium, but it's also got some different value. So, like, in parallel, could we be talking, calling 60 teachers about Earth science stuff just to learn what their Earth science milieu is? I don't know. And like, to what end that's, you know, ill gotten or ill used time? I don't know. But.

Speaker A: I guess this is my bias or my orientation, whatever you want to call it. But the more direct feedback we can get from customers, the better, both because. And because I do think that's been what's lacking here to a large extent. You guys have great ideas, but they're solutions looking for the problems. And you've been really good at tying those together when it's for free. What we need to do is build out the back end of that again. That's where I'm coming from. You guys can decide if that's.

Speaker B: Yeah, I do take a little bit, you know back at that. Because every one of our projects we're working with teachers and while we are focused on the content of that project there's lots of conversations about like what their lives are like what issues are going on.

Speaker E: But we're working with.

Speaker B: We've got specific questions about that. But I don't. It makes it sound like we're off in an ivory tower somewhere and have no idea what's going on. No, I've talked about.

Speaker A: Yeah, you've talked about it.

Speaker E: Right.

Speaker C: Don't have teachers, many teachers who stay with us once our project's done right. You know we pay them to do our stuff and then you. We don't see a lot of them. We see good hand like our, our Uber users but a lot of people do not keep staying with us, you know that kind of thing. And so I do think that there we have a specific slice of teachers who you know, we find and use.

Speaker D: And I think it's depending on the price product too. Like the people who use like Geotech rocks. We get them every year. The Wildfire people are pretty committed. The Jenna whatever people are all the time. They're our biggest fans.

Speaker E: So we have used, we have early adopters. We do have so but that, that says the same story. We've got early adopters and we don't know anything about the people who aren't using.

Speaker B: An interesting thing might be to ask some of the teachers that you know, we still have their kind contact information, you know, are you still using it? If not, why not? You know I, I suspect a lot of them will be like it just takes too long to do this thing and while you've been paying me to do it I, and I've got support from my, you know I talked to my admin and say I'm doing this NSF funded project. They kind of give you special space to do some things but I don't know, I actually don't know what we meant.

Speaker A: Not too far down the road. I would advocate for is formal advisory boards for each subject, perhaps each segment, however we choose to define it so that you have people who by definition are staying on beyond just the completion of the project and become champions among. So there's more peer to peer engagement which I found is an effective way to promote technology. Take my word for it as the Builder of it.

Speaker H: I was going to say PHET does that. They have teacher advisors that are part of every thing. They come in weekly and talk with them every week. Yes, we have PD sessions and you go look at how they use it in the classroom. But at least I don't interact with teachers. They don't come to planning meetings. We don't have a teacher other than you guys who were teachers. So that's different. Yeah, and that's similar to the advisory board thing, but for certain projects we.

Speaker D: Do have, we do work closely with teachers like we always have.

Speaker G: Yeah, but within the scope of the project.

Speaker D: Right, within the scope of the project.

Speaker E: Teachers who are pre identified, teachers who are paying, teachers who. I mean there's so many variables to.

Speaker D: That that are teachers of things we're.

Speaker E: Not developing, they're paying. I'm just, I'm. No, I'm just saying like the teacher teachers that we have in our circle are self selected, are doubly self selected.

Speaker A: One thing we haven't talked about that I kind of think of as another conversation is the service engagements with other partnerships and all that kind of thing. That's really, as I see it, kind of a separate track, a separate discussion. I suspect we all know some people, some organizations that we can reach out to that might have interest in collaborating, partnering, subcontracting. I haven't focused on that as much. I mentioned to you or one of you, both of you, that I have a couple of suggestions. We can pursue that also as relatively short term effort with minimal time or expense.

Speaker F: Yeah, I mean Chad and I have been doing that. Sort of, you guys.

Speaker E: Yeah, that one's more connection. Yeah, that one's pretty.

Speaker F: Yeah, like, you know, I'll give you.

Speaker E: We definitely, definitely want contest. Yeah. And that one's, you know, slightly bifurcated in that like the big lobe of that is we already sort of understand that we need lots more context, but we've got like things to show and the story to tell and contracts we can use. And the other one is the like version of this, but publish it. Like we've learned that this could be a real opportunity. And here is a thing that we're presenting to you. Those are those times we're saying, what do you need? So that latter one we might be able to inform with all this a.

Speaker A: Little bit further downstream.

Speaker F: Right. The nimble thing up at the, the top there. Like you tell us what you want, we'll figure out.

Speaker A: Yeah, except you're competing with India.

Speaker E: Yeah, we know.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker E: That'S a strength and a weakness. Right. It's an opportunity and a threat. You know, once. Once you can. Once you've tried India, then they look more attractive.

Speaker A: Yeah, it is starting to come back on shore. All that.

Speaker F: What do you know, didn't work out.

Speaker A: All that.

Speaker G: I tried it too.

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker A: That. That covers my agenda, guys. I. I hope you found it was useful. I am very eager for, you know, any feedback or suggestions you guys have. I'll just leave it to that kind of business cards are packed.

Speaker E: That's fine.

Speaker A: Some of you have my contact info.

Speaker G: And I'll share it.

Speaker E: Yeah, that's fine.

Speaker A: And yeah, you know, I felt it was productive. Hope you feel the same way.

Speaker E: I think it's. Pick it up again, massively useful. Great to take advantage of the fact that you could still walk over here and not zoom from across the country as it will be or flying, but. But hopeful that, you know, the 11th is a second pass at this. And I think this is launching us into the country kind of thing that we need to be doing yesterday in so many ways. It's really great.

Speaker D: Thank you.

Speaker E: Thank you.

Speaker A: Oh, my pleasure. Thank you, guys. I know it's my kind of nerdiness, not yours.

Speaker E: That's great.
