Me: My god. Is made. How awesome. Yeah. Pop in a video too. Wow. Mhmm. That's crazy. Wait. Where did you send it in? It must have my dance filter on. It's in always It is in Slack. Left out. I didn't see it. I'm only kidding. I'm trying to Helen's has one l. I know I looked it up. Weird. I'm not sure if you could ask. She is asking for the Zoom link. Message? Yes. I guess so. Let's see. Do we have one? Yeah. They're There's gotta be one. It's just not in thing. Oh, do you have it? Is there one it's in the the It's on the calendar, but She's not awake. Really. I don't see it, Anderson. And Sue, you you may not be in the Nobody's coming out. With Jim? Oh, I was looking in the wrong week. Oh. Possibly. Next week doesn't have one. Uh\-huh. Right. Yeah. That's what I was looking at and noticing those now. I don't think it needs one because there's no to. Right. Yes. So so we have to get the letter from each consultant. That we haven't identified yet. Yeah. I don't know how they handle that. I think maybe we should Just saying not to get Karen Greenhounds? Yes. It's really I don't know if we have That's okay. You look great. I love the silhouette. You can speak anonymously. Like an interrogation. Exactly. She's joining Wow. To protect her identity. Yeah. So they shine the light on her. Morning. Told you not Yes. Good morning. Did not expect you to Yeah. We left it open, but did not have any expectations. Time for me to get back on East Coast time anyway. Good enough. Alright. So let me find this in my tab. Oh, it's right here. Okay. So so I updates, a debrief, and then, discussion about the elephant that wandered into the room on Friday. Exactly, yes. Everybody Yeah. The world So, yeah, so Danielle as we know, is coming next Tuesday, September 2\. She's excited. We have a picture already available and, up. What do people need to know that that they don't know about onboarding? It's happening on Tuesday. Wanna have a strategy session here in person to involve her. Yes. On Tuesday next week, everybody from this group could be in the office that would be great. We are gonna have a strategy meeting from 10:30 to twelve It'll be not a typical strategy, meaning it's more gonna be, like, where are we at? What have we done towards each of kind of the categories of things we've been working on. So we'll put together agenda that will kind of be the start to a lay of the land of Fort Danielle. Know, for her to understand the people in this group, the roles that everybody plays, and then just kind of what people have been working on. Over the last few months. Then we'll do the a a lunch somewhere. We'll go out to lunch. And then the afternoon, she'll be doing some more HR paperwork. Checking in with Chad and Sue. Stuff just as a first day. And then Thursday, again, in the office, and there'll be some more kind of like orientation style meetings. For Danielle. The thing I think to note for, like, Dan, Amy, Leslie, Jay, who's not here, would be that we want Danielle to set up individual meetings with you all. Just to kind of get to know you and to understand the things that you worked on, the ongoing projects. Types of things you're interested in. Working on next, proposals that you might be coming up with. So we're gonna put that on her to schedule those. So just kind of look out for those over the course of next week and the following Yep. We've got a DC schedule. Thanks to Kiley and everybody for her the first week or two ish, including coordinating with Rick and laying out the plans that he's sort of helped us lay out with goals and things. And setting them in her lap to, you know, take on, push back, own, etcetera. And I think it's a good balance of not overwhelming her but not saying, here you go, and walking away letting her swim. Why we're not seeing that? That What what Rick and and you all are setting up with her? Or is this No. There's no reason in particular at all. We've just been I I mean, because it would help us in talking with her to know what the hell her goals are. Yeah. No. I'm happy to share it right now. Yeah. Right Rick We're still trying to get it into a form that's edible. Oh, okay. Rick works in. Uh\-huh. Okay. So we're sense. Cynthia. It makes Cynthia and I cringe every time, but he sends a new version of something every time we meet with him. So Sue and I met a little bit last week to try to put piece some of the things together, and now I just it's on as of yesterday afternoon, it's on my to do list this week. To it into a Google Doc version that will be shared with Danielle, which then we can share with we can share with you guys in advance. Okay. So that, you know, I just I'm need to Yeah. Put it in a Alright. Was just curious. Digestible format. But I think what's interesting to hear sort of out loud is that sounds a little bit too like Danielle is in a way coming up, not totally redefining her job position or title or whatever her activities, But you sat in QC is the right negotiation. Like, so even how we describe what she's gonna do, she might describe it. Sure. She has Yeah. Because her to be able to do it instead Exactly. Yeah. But it was I thought that was in the description. You know, I'm all agency. Exactly. Yeah. Understand all of the words and all of the whatever, you know, and being able to to have overlap especially because she's talking to to us individually. It's like, okay. Yeah. And that I mean. I won't you know, dad. You know? Bring her ice coffee and be her best friend. So tell anybody else that. Oh, yes. Uh\-huh. All all the drafts are in the Danielle onboarding folder in the Concord strategic development folder. You consult every morning. 05:30 before you work every day. Uh\-huh. None from there. Check. Right. Yeah. So we can tell you when they're near finalized, but, also, if you you know you are curious. Yeah. But the because I don't need developing. Process is much as I just want. Yeah. And and the the high level is it's foundation season, you know, as soon as she hits the ground. So So really trying to get, you know, letters of intent and pursue leads on foundations. Somewhat in parallel, but a little staggered, you know, do we call them? Companies, industry, I don't know, you know, sponsorship, that's the word, sponsorships from industry. Which you know, are sort of budget season but sort of not for them. And then thinking about individual donors and other things going on, then smearing into ongoing with some numbers that are sort of out there in the air and to be honed, I think. Mhmm. Sneering. She just, like, blackmail leverage on it? Exactly. Yes. Mhmm. She doesn't know about next Thursday. To be in person. Right. Right. Julia or somebody should probably reach out to her. Maybe Judy could reach out to her about that. Yeah. I'm assuming Judy's Yeah. She's in Westford. Harvard. Yeah. Harvard. Right. Yeah. I was like, we can probably talk to her. I was assuming she'll probably I mean, I don't know what it seemed like that's what she was expecting, so I think that we need to figure that out. I also think that we need to we we had talked a while ago about us being in the office more frequently and Concord being in the office. Office more frequently. Frequently. So I think that that's something we should figure out what that means. Yeah. Yeah. And that might be a not written agenda item to at least start to touch on for ourselves here to get input on post September 2, which will be next week Yeah. Binges for how we orient ourselves as an organization. We could make it so she only talks to people in person. And people be Right. That Problem solved. That's it. Okay. Other so thanks to folks who have been helping coordinate that more than I have. I think good to give her a soft ish landing so that not confusing, but give her some space. So second point, an update. I just sent a calendar invite out Hopefully, I didn't clobber too many things that were unknown, although Jay's not here for clobbering some of her meetings. But had been already thinking about this in doubly thinking about it since the Friday thing, which we'll talk about more, having some in person sharing session of ideas and ideation for proposals. Twofold, as Kiley was alluding to, Danielle's here, so she'll be able to listen in, but it's you know, first and foremost to serve us and sort of get the, thinking going both in terms of strategy and in terms of of ideas. We can talk more about that coming up, but that's aimed be here for people who can be here but to have a remote aspect. And to have lunch for people who can be here. And it's meant to encompass lunch. Which will be brought in on Thursday. Including anybody who wants Yes, and I included Chris, Rebecca, Kate, who's not actually going to be here, but maybe she or her schedule's flexible, and then, all the PI folks Bill, and all of us in here, and Danielle, And Aditi could point why did I not put it on? Yes. I will. Mhmm. And Adivi can only be available eleven to twelve, Chad. If you need to tell her, please do reschedule. Reschedule your twelve to two meeting or understand the economy. Here from eleven to twelve. Alright. I will do that. Thank you. Thank you. K. Right. And I didn't put tsun on this because I was just processing, but I did I talked about proposals with her when I was checking in with her the other week, and she's he's on. I mean, he has proposal ideas, so I don't know what to do with that. Yeah. Mhmm. Did I say that loud? You did. Sorry. Yeah. What what would be the downside? I can't imagine a downside to it. I think she's got good ideas. I think she can propose like anybody can. Right. Because he's had one of the people that Danielle should be talking to? To? That's a good question. Probably in some way, shape, or form. But, like, a second pass then. Yeah. I don't know. You can ask be in the first week. Right. Because we're not paying his son for all these hours we're asking. Asking her to be at meetings. Okay. Right. Exactly. Yeah. And I invited This is a kind of awkward question. I know. Yeah. No. No. It is. I I know she has to be asked. Yeah. She's I mean, she's gonna hear the name. Right? You know? Mhmm. It's been month Right. I we got you on this list, but I'm holding on But she's gonna hear that. For Leslie's benefit, I put Scott on that list. I did not put you on the calendar invite, so you don't have to think anything, September 4\. So just it's your it's I thought Scott would be interested in being there as well. Mhmm. She won't be thinking about anything. I know. That's good. Just making sure she has more not to think about anything. That's good. Good. Good. Cake or hot chocolate. That's exactly the key. Let's is gone. Gone. Gone. Mhmm. Look to the left. Look to the right. Okay. She's already threatened once not to come back from Amsterdam. Oh, that's a fair very fair threat. Exactly. Yeah. Wow. You did you did turn find my phone on with her when you I know. Exactly. We need to do the Just in case. Right? We keep tabs on you. Let's see. Okay. So I I just put this in so people knew that we had had a call with the board on Friday. They were pleased with all the work we've been doing. They thought we'd been doing the the kinds of things that they were, you know, encouraging. They were Danielle was there for fifteen minutes of the foundation piece and was her bubbly and enthused self, just giving her background. And I think that got people on board to the fact that we're moving forward on that piece. We had a brief sort of discussion section at the end about what was the first topic? Oh, I talked about user discovery a little bit just to let them know that we've been talking about that. We talked about licensing a little bit as well, which is a pin in that conversation that we need to have as an organization, sooner rather than later. To recognize that people who are making money off of our stuff are do can right now do it any way they want. And we don't want that. And we also have reputational considerations around saying we're not open source. So we have to wrestle that through, but it was very clear that the board was like, yeah, yeah, shouldn't be making money on your stuff without your permission. And I think that's generally our mode as well. But are nuances to be had in that. Mhmm. We can add that. Noncommercial to all of our Mhmm. License And it gets I mean, again, nuances. We gets complicated when you add noncommercial to maybe its content. Do we do that with with code? We allowed to do that with all of our code? Do we want to? Is it GPL? You know, again, you know, pin in that. An issue with code as much as contact tracing? Probably not, and we should talk about that some. Okay. So more on that probably relatively soon, but not today. Go. Yeah, please. Okay. Yep. So part of our And I let them know that participate one hundred percent participation was our goal. As Daniel gets here, was aiming for that. Down payment on a future one, anything that was just I should check off the box was what mattered, so I'm gonna mail them again nonstop gets here and try to get them all on board within that next week or two. So that we can check off those boxes as we start to apply the foundations. Stuff we need to know about upcoming conferences, focus groups? So we're registered for MASSQ as an exhibitor. The way it works is they will send me an email when they want. Like, names of people who are attending. So the table comes with two like, registrations, basically, two name tags. To get you into the conference. So if we are kind of swapping those two people out for the following day with the people who are gonna be either presenting or at the table. Will need to have we'll need to just register two more. Just people. And it's it's discounted. Just put Trudy and me. We will. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. So we'll just it's you know, another maybe hundred hundred $50 to get two more registrations associated with our table. So we'll just just do that. And we have we can do presentations because that comes with the table. Correct. Yeah. So there's a presentation on Wednesday. And a pres on Thursday. I forget which one you have. But I sent you a calendar invite. They gave me the time slot. So that is the time slot you will be presenting. Calendar so you know when you're presenting once I have, like, further information. Tuesday, the day before the conference starts, we can go down and set up the table. So I've already recruited Amy to come with me to go down to Prospero and just get the table set up. And models running. Like, it's very visual, and things are moving. Like, eye catching from people who walking by. Yeah. That would be great. I know, Chad, you said desktop or bookshelf. I have I had a chance to chance to bring it back to the office yet, but I don't think you need it before I get back. It it's just one of those little plastic trash barrels, which is convenient to have under the Okay. Yeah. And I think we have the box of Just don't put it where random people can see it because they Right. Trash Mhmm. Yep. So, yeah, we'll need, like if I don't know if we have a tablecloth or something. Like, get to inventory for it. It might still have. It's been years. I don't even have it. Yes. We found logo or something. Don't have it, we should order a new one. There's a banner right outside this door, at least one. There might be more than one. Yeah. They did have some rules about that, like, size of them and Yeah. It's pretty this is pretty standard. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm sure they're standard. And it's all within that. So Yep. That's from Mass Q. Can I just say Yeah? All the stuff you find or gather today for this if we're not using it or even if we are, if we could throw it in that middle room. Yep. Yeah. Office. That would be helpful. Then we can start keeping the inventory still there. And That's a good plan. So, yeah, for Mass Q, that's they're kind of it's, like, the bigger, more formal one. And then for Mass, which is the Massachusetts Science Teacher Association, we are registered as an exhibitor for that. And Chad said that he would attend. We can have other people attend. As well if you're interested in manning the booth with Chad. We do need to if you wanted to eat lunch at the conference, we would have to buy an extra lunch ticket. So Oh, you can have my lunch ticket. So But, yeah, that one is Yeah. We should think about contacting them about focus group possibilities because that would be a good place to do probably the better one to do the focus group. Stuff. So so and then the KS TA one? Stephanie is organizing it as a ticketed breakfast for 12 to 15 people. Okay. We'll see. Know, she's like, oh, that should be no problem to get. But she wants a ticket so that we know who's showing. Right. That makes sense. And so she'll I'll I'll find out a little bit more. Gets that together. That's great. So, Patty, back to mask you. Sorry. I think maybe I was misunderstood. We're doing a bit of tent to And Jay and Dana are doing presentations. Yes. So We are not doing focus group. I don't think it's gonna work out in the way that we would want it to. Like, I we don't have access to a space to hold the focus group unless we just held it at our booth. Is probably not the best place for our focus group. Conversation. So are I mean, the main thing you could the main thing you could do is you could instead of the presentation, you could turn that into a focus group, but that's probably the only thing you could do. It would be, like, one on one conference. Conversation, or we could do the thing that you been talking about with is have the iPad and do, like, a three to five question survey and people get entered to win something if they fill it out. If if we wanted to gather if we had targeted questions that we wanted to ask at MassQ, I think that would be a fine way to to get user feedback. Because if you don't have target questions we're doing the doing templates. And I thought that was the question. Like, why is the download of just I do think that there focus groups send an iPad with a survey people who don't mutually exclusive. Like, we have a table we're gonna be sitting there for hours. Hours. Yep. Put it here. Like, Yeah. Answer a short survey to enter into a grapple for Mhmm. $50 gift. Card. And so we can get that feedback in if we could do That's the two. Yeah. I think the other thing is Chad had mentioned, like, we do have the two fifty minute presentations. Slots. At Mass Q. Like, we could basically turn one those. Into some type of focus group. It's just I'm not sure that we can say, like, how many people get people to, like, register ahead of time so we know many people we're dealing with. Like, we they were very clear We do not share the list. That contact list of attendees with you. Did you have to give them names or abstracts? For the proposal? For the sessions? No. So they really can't Nothing yet. They they did say, like, on their website, that you have to submit an RFP for this presentation. Slot. But the the RFP was since closed. Right. By the time we registered to be an exhibitor, so I didn't I couldn't submit it. So I was kinda waiting for somebody to contact me. In the in the program. If you want anybody to come to these things, we have to submit something They're just very clear. Like, wait for us to come. You. Like, I don't even have a like, I've already reached out to the email address that they said please send an email if you have questions, and it like radio silence. So, like Some of them. Yeah. Yeah. It's very much like we will we will contact you with next steps. Like, don't bombard us. Kind of thing. Thing. It's like the language that I've gotten on the website. Website. So yeah, I I sent them an email two weeks ago. I registered last week. I'm just waiting Like definitely registered You got all the receipts. And the confirmation email. From the conference. That you're registered as a nonprofit exhibitor So it's just a matter of of sitting and waiting. Next set of instructions. Basically. So should we decide whether we wanna do one of the presentations as a focus groupie thing. To say. Come influence the next generation now. Right. That's I'm trying to think about how you would do that exactly, but I think you I mean, certainly could. Think I think it would be you know, there's any way we can do a focus group, I think it would be silly. To lose the opportunity. I mean Yeah. I think think people would come to a thing like, come this What's the next? Generation. Yeah. Well, and if you don't get I mean, if you only get 10 people, that's good to some degree degree too. I mean, the only issue would be if you had 40 people who were packing in, then you were trying to figure out how but you could say limited or something like that. You could have two people there instead of it into 2,000\. That's true as well. Dan's on a horn to Jay. Right. Get over over there. Since over to whoever who was Yeah. Be around anyway. Yeah. I think the idea is we would have at least two people there each day, maybe three. Depending on avail availability. Like, Mhmm. With dance presenting and that Right. Table by herself or Dan's Focus. Group. Ideally, you have two people doing the focus group and then we're gonna need at least one person at the table. So Mhmm. So, yeah, I think I would say on focus group day, we need three people there. Yeah. Right. Presentation day. Yeah. Like, if Jay wanted just do a fifty minute presentation, presentation or workshop, just that I'll think. Days is it again? Is it It's on Wednesday, Thursday. Okay. It's all during the week. So it's not as if there's a day that would be obviously more people. Okay. So Wednesday, Thursday, Yeah. Wednesday, Thursday, because the setup is Tuesday. K. Yeah. Do we wanna do the survey thing? In addition to? I thought I think I've why not as long I mean assuming there's Wi Fi which may or may not be. There may be. Okay. Then yeah. We should easy enough. You'd you know, coin toss whether you get people or not, but get somebody, got them. Start to try to get her an answer to that. And the intention with the survey is to get names to call. I mean, I think it's getting feedback on some questions but also, like, it'd be great We can say, hey. Would you be willing to be interviewed for us to follow\-up? I think we got think about the questions. Like you know, when that we just asking the same questions we've been asking, or do we have, like, three to five new targeted questions Yeah. More answers to? Like know, maybe we take a look at the notes from the Tri State Focus Group and our conversation last time, and saying know, we know we wanna know more of about Open SciEd. How are teachers using it? Like, maybe we can just focus the survey on that. Mhmm. Yeah. We have the survey that we did do already, so maybe there's one or two questions there. Maybe one or two questions from that. And then the survey from one? The one we sent out originally that we didn't use. The tone of answers on. Mhmm. Just I'm just naming the surveys to look at. We had one. It was called NSCA. I don't know, 2024\. Yeah. That was deliberately a follow\-up from a presentation. Yes. So for all the people who were presenting at stage one twenty four, there were half a dozen them? You were all encouraged to send them to the survey. Because you the first question was, which which Right. Group did you go Sorry. Which workshop did you attend? Right. You know, the code app usage model, the or science, whatever it was. Mhmm. And then the questions were, would you recommend this to it? If so, why? Those kinds of things. And then the last questions was, would you be willing to talk to us? Well reach out to you. Yep. There may be one or two questions. It wouldn't be as if it's not going too long. A workshop on AI. But still, would you recommend the Conflict Consortium in general Mhmm. You know, to a friend? Do you do you know the name Concord Consortium? Yep. Concord There might be a few questions. We have a lot of surveys. Yep. We have a lot of questions. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. Already a lot of stuff. Been written. Yeah. I have that ongoing neuroscience survey was great. I think you know, for the purpose of this group and the things we've been talking about, it would be worthwhile to revisit our notes from last week where we had a debrief on the tri state focus group. Mhmm. We talked a lot about, like, open side. That was a big topic of conversation. Yep. I would be surprised if it wasn't again, that some of these teacher conferences. And so if there's anything we wanna know, assuming the attendance is gonna be much larger at Mass Q, Right. And we'll probably get more foot traffic by the booth. And so, you know, if it's a short survey, something easy for people to fill out, you know, they spend five minutes at our booth. Fill out a survey. Enter to win a Yep. Give the also think about the audience. Audience. Who pretends mask you. Educators. You know, that's a broad term, but it's teachers. And Yeah. It's not necessarily science teachers. It's more of people who are sort of interested in, I mean, technology. Using it. Yeah. Right. Mhmm. Just the theory everybody knows. Nowadays. Yeah. But it's still gonna get people who are interested Yeah, it's it's local local isthes are the best way of framing it. Yeah, I think we can start to get organized on what that survey would be and Mhmm. What are the Yeah. And there's a certain certain suite. We have. For a survey versus what are what's better to discuss a focus group? I don't know what's interesting in an interview. I mean, essentially, if you're doing a one on one that's a lot of time. You should you know, because somebody's gonna have to call if we're saying we want know, we're gonna call. Mhmm. You know, who's doing the follow\-up calls and what should calls be Yeah. And I don't think we're commit I mean, I think I think we do wanna do but we're not committing to that in this survey in the same way as these people who are responded in '24\. I'll still email them and say, hey. You mentioned way back when. Would you be willing So may not need to worry exactly about what we're asking for that call, but we want to know enough about them that we if we're going call them we know they're a fourth grade teacher versus something else. So you have two, three, two slots. One is now gonna be the surface group thing. Yep. What do we want the other one to be? Well, Jay is gonna be doing if you're gonna do the focus group, it's gonna be Jay. Doing the other presentation. Jay is not as well versed on all of things that Concord. Right. Was just thinking having something like a broad Yeah. Here's here's our digital resources. That might be the one other one to do. Because I thought maybe I was gonna be doing that. Right. Right. Too. And Jay's was thought Jay was gonna do something on AI. Right. Which would make a lot of sense for her to do. Oh, for sure. But I don't know. I mean, we probably Open to either, I think. Yeah. I'd So here's here's my my take on this. At the tristate meeting, we heard a lot of interesting things and dug deep into the open side and stuff. Which was all kind of news to me. Like, there was of that community to that as a problem, as a pain point was a big surprise. Surprise. For me. Maybe not for others. But for me. In the survey that we sent out, I think the number one thing that emerged was AI issue. So even if Jay is just giving her presentation, if we could somehow side by side with that or maybe as, like, a teaser to go to that presentation. You know, ask a question at the booth or something. Right? Like, is I is AI a thing that you're trying to integrate in? Into your classroom? You know, is it a problem? I don't know how to ask these questions. Exactly. But right, if we could plug that and and find out, like, whether that's that's real or an illusion. And if it's, like, less or more important, then the open sciatic thing or as important or something. Right? Like, like, now I don't know which one of those things to focus on. Right? Right. We do the same one. Well, realized that Jay doesn't need to present for the entire fifty minutes. I mean, she can stop at forty or thirty five and put a survey out for people or could stop at twenty and have a conversation for twenty. I mean, lots of ways to do that. Yeah. Just put a note in the notes Mhmm. That as you were talking, Leslie, it was like, dawned on me that we should have some type of little flyer or card that has, like, hey. We're presenting at this time and this time on this topic. Yep. Definitely. And a QR code to fill out the Right. When happens the day before before. The focus on now. Yes. So she can also Right. She's Wednesday. She's Wednesday. Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah. And I definitely need a little table topper that says you know, we're presenting. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And and you wanna read careful. I mean, you probably don't need to advertise the focus group that much, you know, or you're gonna get lots you might get lots of people, and you probably don't want that. So maybe you have a sign up or something. Who knows? Yeah. So I'm just saying, like, your question would naturally dovetail with presentation. I mean, I would be interested even just to know Jay's stuff teaches teaches about how AI works. It does not use AI to teach. Mhmm. Or to assist students And I would be fascinated to know whether people think that that's great or not really what they were hoping for. Mhmm. It does seem like there are two strands of AI stuff they want AI literacy. Yep. But what that means to different people. Might be like, I need I know how to use Chad GPT as my AI literacy as opposed to. I know how ChatGPT works. Right. So, you know, like, there's a there's an issue there, and I don't I that's that's all I yep. I don't have a form plan, but it seems like they can't put that. Yep. Totally agree. Yeah. So it seems like the the you know, big section steps are figuring out questions for the focus group. Which are probably deriving from some of the things that we want to know from previous focus groups. And any sort of guidance on questions survey for the AI presentation. And then there's a survey at the booth question, figuring out the survey questions for the booth. About the minority, but are there any questions about data science, earth science stuff that we actually do? As opposed to, you know, like, is there a way to find out anything as opposed to just assume, you know, like, you know, how we might I don't know what that is. But, you know, I think that there's a question about what we have You know? And and how we think about that in terms of getting in in insights like you may not know you need this until you hear about kind of thing. Mhmm. I mean, everybody I mean, the question about AI is nobody under actually understands all the variations of AI, and and you know, So it it's the most obvious It's grok and chatty PT. As opposed to all the machine learning and all of the feedbacks and all of you whatever. So so I I I just you know, the the pain points for sure and not leading the the the people, but there's also the we've gotten shit. Mhmm. Which I think Yep. Is like you know, why we need to figure out how Dan can do his thing. Right? Like, here's my library of stuff Yeah. Mhmm. Digital resources. Not overlook. The power Right. Presenting and highlighting the eye. And to be clear, there's also when you're doing user interviews, you know, if we're following up with people here or in general gathering names and having targeted fifteen minute interviews with a whole bunch of users, that's often too when you're saying, okay, here's a set of things that we think might have some value for people not presenting those things, but we're asking them questions about their pain points in our science. Or about their pain points in something. Then you can get then you can sort of target and move that conversation more with one person too. There's more than one way to ask those kinds of things. Yeah. Well, I just Totally. I was just putting it out. Yeah. We're shutting the door we have to sort of understand how the stuff that we've got might be That's why I was thinking the other presentation should be, like, your your standard NSTA, like, we'll tell you about all the amazing things we're doing with. Right. Could very well be. I've got I've got three of those in Minneapolis. Yeah. The the transcript is exactly the same. Yep. It is. Now it changes AI. Yeah. Earth science and something. Data. Well, this is this is why I'm interested in the next topic of discovery because I still feel like just don't get where we're going. Yeah. And Right. So so right. So and I was just gonna transition to that. So I, you know, I had a good conversation with mean, but good with David Sharon, who is a person who helped us in the Pose, work. And, just sort of laid out for him that, you know, we're trying to think about our know, body of work, you know, a little bit differently and understand sort of customers a little bit differently. And you know, the end shot of that was that he gave me a name of somebody who's in Portland who he said was really good with this stuff who I mailed, earlier this morning. And you as somebody who has done sort of a full set of kind of different consulting roles for startups and other groups for twenty years and worked with the main startup community, etcetera. So I'm hoping that she might be a lead for this rickish kind of person in that domain. What are we doing for it? I think it's I think the question that you're getting at is exactly one of those questions. And the question that we're describing here. It's sort of some combination of we've got a lot of stuff the world has a lot of needs, Are there matches between those that we're not recognizing that might be bridged in some way that we don't know about them. Like, oh, okay. We're we thought we were developing this something, but people really need this It's not that far from what we're developing if we got a new proposal if we framed it differently or what have you, would people use it more, be happier, would we be able to do something different with it, etcetera. The bigger question within that too is really just the head scratching question of the board says, I guess again, not a product company. We've got all this stuff What do we do with that fact? And there's sort an existential identity question, do we say we're R and D in double down? But can you use the R at all nowadays? The open question is there. Do we think about product and say, Oh, we're seeing these needs, We really do wanna develop two different things and try making products out of them by pairing with some other companies. Might we tease that out? So this user discovery goes together with product development in general, But it's part of that mix. And I would hope that somebody could come in and at least say, don't ask 10 questions, Here are a couple sets of questions to ask, and if you want to really get that answer, yeah, actually user enabled is the way to get that answer Focus groups are the way to start to understand something. How do we use this arrows in our quiver kind of thing. More than that I don't know, and the answer might be like you're barking up the wrong tree. Like we that's fine. We I'm At least if we knew that six months from now, and we shouldn't be thinking about this at all, all about partnering with companies Okay, let's figure that out too. No. It's fine. Get off that topic, but I'm looking at the nasty thing. They do have a published like, Oh, it's digital, so presumably they'll be able to add somehow. The time slot that at least I have on mind schedule doesn't fit in with the like slots they have for sessions. So Interesting. They may have different exhibitors or something. You know? Right. So we may be confused. Other I yeah. They had two time three time slots available that I picked. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not good. It's the one that was filmed on Wednesday, Yeah. Just picked one of the two that were available on Thursday. So Mhmm. And it's useful just to read titles and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Things that are here. Mhmm. There's, like, 10 in a row. They have the AI in Of course. Right. Can you link that into the note? Yeah. Just so I can look at it later. And just so Yeah. I'm just spinning this out Good. The so if we have Jay do a twenty minute presentation and then there's another thirty minutes left in her session. And the and what we want her to do or someone to do in that room is to figure out, like, is is this teachers what you want in AI, or is it something slightly different from this? Or just, like, oh, that was an interesting presentation, but now Yeah. I guess really me how you're complicated when you're know, and maybe it's B before A or something too. I mean, you could have a conversation and then show stuff. I don't know. I mean Yeah. I haven't thought this through. Like, for for me, I was thinking, like, well, we wanna know is what pressures are they feeling? To include AI and what is it they actually want? You know, those might be two separate things. Do they know it? They want? Mhmm. Oh, they might not know what they want, or they might say, I want AI to do all my grading. Or I want AI to Mhmm. Like, come up with differentiated lesson plans or whatever. Is. But I could imagine that they're asked to to do something about AI, and either it's really vague or they're pressured do something specific that they think is useful. Or whatever. Like, all of that stuff would be, I think helpful to know. Mhmm. I could ask. I mean, Jay's not here, but twenty minutes on going through whatever AI curriculum that she has right now is very brief. I don't know if her goal like, asked her what her goal is at to take have teachers sign up, to use the activity, whatever. Like, twenty minutes is brutally sure. Yeah. I think And and it's hands on. Go to this URL and click on a thing or understand Yeah. Mhmm. Text class. Models about which ice cream is the best or whatever. More than fine. Minutes. I think I mean, well, one, Leslie will bring her curriculum units are pretty long. Right. Right? So You can't go through it like that. But I do think the variety of AI that she has is would be very appealing the audience at most. View. Right? It's not a to Dan's point, it's not a science teacher. Yeah. Conference. So, you know, she does have, like, an English language arts set of curriculum that would reach a wider audience Right? Like, we just advertise, like, Consortium. STEM, you know, science like, we're only gonna get science teachers right now that can kind of appeal to. An audience that we normally at the conferences that we typically go to. So, yeah, I think Yeah. Giving her a little bit time. And even if it's that and a ten minute survey, that's also valuable of the targeted people who came to her thing. You know? So I think there are a number of ways to roll it that would still be useful. I guess especially if since we know all the other AI things that are going on that this conference. We can have that survey encompass a lot of ideas that they might have been introduced to. Right. To more points that came from my conversation with David Sharon just in term and report out mode. He said, Yeah, guess what? Lots of people are thinking about transitioning from just NSF dependency. He talked about storytelling. Said it takes a while to figure out how to think about effective stories about philanthropic funding, requires thinking more about he said, philanthropists want to feel good about impact. You know? And so about effective stories that lift up specific individuals and things like that was part of what he mentioned was important. And in the portfolio piece when I said, Yeah, we've got all this stuff, He said, yeah. I mean, the portfolio, you know, review is something that needs to happen with this. And sometimes you think about what things are important in that. He mentioned Berkeley as a college, I guess, in some ways. They have a model where he said they sunset projects every ten years not necessarily because they're bad, but just deliberately because, like, you can sort of get stuck on a thing that's okay but not great too. So he was like, may you know, you wanna think about what to lift up and what things are going to be important, and that might mean saying, okay, that thing not so much. Right. At this point, we don't of what we're trying to discover. Right? Like, you know, if and and and it's not clear to me what we're trying to elevate or what we're not trying to Exactly. Mhmm. Can't do it all, clearly. That's the the part that you know, that that are we elevating? And this this is right back at the very beginning, which is everybody is in the AI space. Because that's the big hot new word, and that's you know? And yes, that's also where money is at the moment. But, you know, that we're competing against everybody. And are there places that we're not competing against that we could actually do well in and and I I don't wanna shut that down before we understand. Yep. And so that was sort of where that question comes in in terms of and it and it may be services. It may be content. It may you like, I don't know. Mhmm. But I feel like I worry that it's you know, the sexy AI word. Yep. As sexy as it is. You know? But, you know, that that yeah. But every single fucking person is doing AI. Mhmm. And I well. Not great. And to be able to say, we're gonna do it better How are you going to prove that when we don't have the materials yet? Yep. An important question about the resources that we have and sunsetting things. We got an email yesterday or over the weekend about Geniverse. Yeah. About we getting the source code for Genverse because this teacher and her husband or the other husband and the teacher, whatever it was, really wanna do it. They're they wanted source code for this so called blah blah blah. And we get general on Google Analytics, but, like third most popular across concord.org. Is teaching teaching dragon's nets. Mhmm. Mhmm. That's the page that now says Jennifer's and whatever. Jenna Connect, Molly's other Right. Whatever. Don't exist anymore. Please. Anyway, that page is, like, the third most hit. People still ask about meiosis activity that was within Genever's. Right. Right. So there's still there's trails about all over the planet to be really awful. But, anyway, there are, like, hints that that is crazy. I feel my arm. Yep. Exactly. Mhmm. Yep. Teaches AI. Right. Yep. Or with AI. Yeah. So I think part of part of this user coming implicit in this user discovery piece is this notion of portfolio review of trying to understand, you know, product development and balancing our our effort across that portfolio, which could mean both. It could mean saying, Oh, that thing that we're ignoring, other people aren't. It could mean that thing that we all love. Actually, yeah. All know that dog sounds so pretty. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That there it's gonna there's gonna be some hard things. To hear Mhmm. Potentially. But I think we need to hear it as opposed to ignore it. Totally. Yep. And and so being aware of our language when we're talking to people, and it's like, very narrow and and, you know, at least it's sounds narrow to me because I'm not hearing anything else. Right. Right? Mhmm. So So Mhmm. Yep. When we get the new set of eyes, like, when I did a tiny three second demo of I forget what it was. Jen Ventura is like a new floor or something. Like that. Like, two months ago to Rick, he was like, wow. Mhmm. Like, oh my god. For both of them. And, yes, they were both amazing. But gender retro at this point, I think we all not that we forget about it, but it's just sort of this thing. Right. Yep. It's so ours. It's so old. It's been there so long Right. Mhmm. That we forget just how freaking good it is. Yep. No, that's true. Okay. I did want to take a couple minutes to over debrief Leslie and my conversation. So we had a discussion with some folks in Oakland Unified School who I knew from a proposal that was recently declined from WestEd. They are computer science folks at the district level who have developed a computer science focused curriculum, curriculum module that involves codap, which is why we got into the initial conversation. But they were district level people, so we wanted to have a sort of generalized conversation with them. I'm just looking at the notes here, Leslie. It was interesting to hear them talk about What do people in Oakland do? They kind of went, Oakland is a lot of places and a lot of things. And you know, like, the one thing that seemed to be in common was that they were a Google district. So you could count on Google Workspace services being available in places. But it was kind of teacher by teacher almost beyond that. Some teachers use Schoology, some teachers use LMS, some don't use anything at all. High school was sort of Wild West, mixed of things they described, Google Classroom, Schoology. They said there wasn't there wasn't official district approval process when money was involved. Or essentially contracts were involved. If not, you sort of needed permission, but that was kind of written down, but people didn't really it. So people could kinda take up what they wanted to if money wasn't involved. And things would apply. By default. Right. And things weren't blocked, which he didn't seem to say was that much of an issue, I think. Yeah. Not in that district. District. They're a whole I was a little surprised surprised actually by how, like, yeah, we do we do a car. Mhmm. Yeah. And, you know, we tried to we tried to get a sense of how our people providing feedback, what are they using for digital when are they using digital platforms, and there wasn't a lot of adoption of digital platforms like maybe some elementary curricula were more digital They didn't really have sort of a digital textbook for the were subscribed to from some publisher that was rolled out broadly across things. If teachers did something, they would do it in Google Classroom so the kids could turn it in. And would give feedback to Google Classroom. And that way, they wanted feedback digitally to give to be given to the student. But that wasn't because something was plugged in. And in elementary they used clever and so most of the time in elementary if you were getting something it was through the Clever dashboard. But that seemed like it was mostly an elementary thing for them. I thought Clever was just like a bridge for between. It is, but they also have a marketplace and internal, so you can white list and and list things for your districts, and then you can find so that was where teachers found stuff that they knew was available, is go to Clever go to the third page, click on a thing. It's of becomes this student finding. It was like an Oakland beige and clamor or something? Mhmm. Yeah. That's sort of one of the things Clever does is you have that offering page of stuff that you can enable as a district. Yeah. Dan, too. To say more about that. Like, clever clever is kind of an alternative an alternative solution to the LTI catalog. Right? Like, they basically build that for with whatever resource you tell them to make. Available there. Right? It's part of the service that you get when you pay them money. To to list you. And enable you. I see. I think I thought originally they were just like that single sign on kind of thing. But now But but now it's gotten Yeah. They started that way, Kiki, but the value add for schools is also then findability, discoverability of stuff. We talked a little bit about the codap computer science work that they have, which is more specific, although they talked about needing to save work to Google Drive as one of the things. And then near the end we got into some stuff that I thought was pretty interesting. We kind of talked about their they saw as teachers' pain points. They worked with one of them was a coach, one of them was a district computer science person, worked with lots of teachers. And they talked about integration challenges between platforms being an issue. And you get this in your grade book, you sort of laugh like grade book is totally separate. Probably they just write down the grades and then type them into their school grade book thing. And then we got into an interesting conversation around collaboration that I thought was sort of the meat of it. I remember of what we got out of it. You know? I don't know what your takeaway of that, Leslie, was we really debrief, but sort of talked about how to get information to students and conversations around it. Yeah. There were there was a lot of time. Unpack Yeah. Conversation. But I I think the thing that interested me well, there were a few things. One is that this is not the first time that I have heard there is significant interest among middle and high school level teachers in creating their own curricular materials, which they tend to do in Google. Mhmm. In good Right? Like that. That's one. And I'm frankly astonished. I can't believe they have time to do it. But, apparently, they do. So know, that's kind of an interesting thing. Right? Well, Google is now haven't they rolled out, like, we will use AI in create things. For you right in our system. I, yeah, I doubt the teacher was doing that. Use it. I'm I'm curious. Like, is this a thing that are starting to pick up? Not? Yeah. But, you know, like, yeah, I don't know. The they had a very loose connection. Between their grading system and everything else. Unless it was like, a full fee for featured four pay system. And they didn't to care very much about you did it or not. Other people do. Guys didn't. Right? But but mostly, it's it's the notion that teachers are willing to invest the time to to customize their own materials. You know, it it's just that most people make that kind of heart work. Them because they they they put a up they wall around? Their stuff. The other thing that interested me is that at least from the guy who teaches computer science this was the first person I heard talk about collaborative stuff. Mhmm. Right? Like, I haven't really heard that other people. Maybe because they don't do it or maybe because they don't. Perceive it as anything they care know? Like that it's not a problem. Right. They're doing something. Is fine. And they don't care. They want technology. Mediation. Right. This guy took because he's trying to write code. Right? Trying to get his kids to write code, and as we all know, pair programming is a thing. So you know I Yeah. And, I mean, we did I mean, I did prompt by using the word collaboration at one point in a question, but not much more. And this is not a these aren't teachers. They are people who work with teachers, they might have slightly different aspirations than the teachers. But their their handwriting was I think the takeaway for me was him saying, you know, it's it's one student, one computer. Like, that's what's happening now in the classrooms. And there's not conversation happening around what's happening on the computer. And they mostly pulled out that it's because there's not a way for that to happen. They now have this GoGuardian, which people used to have decades ago, where you can see all screens as a teacher and pull one up on the they're starting to use that. He said, so maybe that will help. But, But he said the real time comparison of difference student approaches is not something that you can do right now. Sort of as a related to that or as a result, the teachers get sort of focused on the grades and the feedback and the what what do I take away from what you did on your screen. As opposed to, what are we all learning here kind of thing, which seemed like a real interesting insight that I know if others would have, but I would love to ask for it in other questionsconversations. Built that all in into the interaction. That was why we built into the report. They go to, like check. I wanna highlight x, y, and z, and then display these things to the class. Mhmm. Right. Yeah. So that's a low fi way to do it. Clue is obviously a very high fi way to do it. Loops did real, real, real time stuff that was you know, heavily interactive, yep, which I don't think we've seen the likes that in many cases otherwise. So we are was was your goal to sort of understand, like, for instance, These people need They didn't say clue. They like, but I mean we're just not not not the goal of the conversation. But I did ask I did use the word collaboration because, you know, I am interested in is there any any thing to that notion of collaboration that people, you know, long for by And in part of that, ask for, you know, ask for what they want and listen for what they need kind of thing too. Right? It's a kind of pattern of classroom interaction. That could exist in the same way that people might do, you know, some of those I'm trying learn that name at work. Where, you know, you put you get expert on one thing, and then you go to different groups. Like, there's different kind of, like, pedagogical approaches. And I think collaborative approach is is interesting one that not everyone is using. And the question is, is that what do people want to do that? I think people all love, like, you know, we're all in these collaborative notes right now. Now. But I don't even know if that's something that teachers want more of. They wish they could do, but you know, they basically they're just a little bit whatever they can do in Google Docs. Is that a pattern they'd like to see everywhere? This is an example. In my mind of having the tools Right. Definitely. This is not just because you build it, people will use it. Mhmm. Because it is a transformation how to use computers. In the classroom. That is unfamiliar. Not that they don't want it or do want it. I don't think they're thinking about it necessarily. Necessarily, but, you know, like, that's, you know, an disorder. Example. Of you know, how do you figure out a you know, a solution for a problem we know exists but the teachers might not be able to articulate and you're not gonna get Yep. No. Exactly. I mean, I think you know, it it felt like a thing that came up, you know, it's like bubbling there to say, oh, okay. Can we poke that and learn more from other people? When I'm still seeing this need for real time comparison of different student approaches. And I can imagine that across lots of things. Do you ever get to compare multiple people's, you know, plate tectonics model approaches and views and whatever, Probably not, but, like, that's probably what we want. And so I'm asking in my head, okay. Like, there be a way to put that notion in front of a teacher and see if they respond? Oh, I could do that. Know? Anything more. Yeah. And that's what the insertion people are interested in that, then what? We do more of it. We ask for a corporation to sponsor us. Well, so so that's the kind of so I might imagine that's the kind of thing where we do that. We sort of feel like there's something there. You could imagine doing a sprint week where we said, oh, how might we provide real time comparison of different student approaches to earth science with it by hacking something in Clue, by making a slide show, and then put it in front of seven teachers on a Friday and see if they're like, oh, that's interesting. Or if they're like, how would I ever deal with that? Right. You can take some vomit, the prototype thing, that we can then ask foundation or Right. Sure. Yep. Mhmm. And then something is both you know, helping teachers PD, and doing more of this. You know? Like, because I don't know, like, there's there's using simulations, using whatever, and then there's using Right. Materials. Right? You know? And I do think that we have to think on both sides. Mhmm. You know? And and getting money for different aspects of it in the same way we tried to build you know, off of ideas from proposals at NSF now. It's just just you know? But Right. Let me I don't quite this is this is again, I I know how to say the NSF. Nobody knows whether this is important. We'll tell you. Mhmm. Versus nobody knows that this is important, but we know it. Right. Forgive us the money. You know that. Right. Well and and it's those glimmers that, you didn't know it wasn't important until you saw it, and then you couldn't let it go kind of thing that I think we're sort of looking for too. And if we can find those in ways that are multiplicative, like when you say all the resources, and we're like, we could put that in collaborative you know, it's called Clue Now, but really it's just simple collaborative framework and that is the meiosis model or the plate tectonics model or the something like if they were interested, all of a sudden you might be in a place where you're leveraging a whole bunch of things in a new model that teachers didn't realize they needed until they saw it. And then all of a sudden, what is that? Is that a proposal? It a product? Is it a I don't know. Someone asked for voltage monitoring code Is you know, can can we is this collaborative? Can kids work on this Mhmm. I said, yeah. They can sit next to each other. Right. Well If they're in the same room, I don't imagine why you would do that. And if there was a feature we heard in the User Interviews for Code app and I heard independently when we were in North Carolina for our mini retreat or what have it was Desmo no. Yes. Desmo's curriculum, has a dashboard where you can see students work in real time. And if you say that to somebody who's used Codet for a while, they will say yes. Like I saw more heads nodding in that idea than anything else. So anyway, there's and this is sort of why we do this. There's a glimmer here of something. Seconds. Lag, twenty second lag on third? Mhmm. Right. I mean, but to be fair, the opposite is true. In, like, Hasbott, we have real time and it was overwhelming for teachers. Like, following things in real time while they're trying to help kids. I'm the So, right. So the, yeah, well, is where the interest, this is where we want to ask Right? Because, like, why is group x asking for this? And why was group z, you know, overwhelmed by it, and is there some attribute that we need to real time time, like, you know, to be able to see Doctor. In the In the Desmos curriculum, it definitely is, and that's what people were asking for with CodeApp, but I don't know about simulation you know, or not. You know, through the dashboard, we have it. It's literally seconds. Blank. Mhmm. Right. But that requires a teacher looking at a computer all the fucking time. I'm just responding. You're saying teachers want it. I'm saying we have it. Right. So it seems like again, this is the sort of thing that we find like, Uh\-oh, there's something there we should ask more about. And if the answer is something that we can't serve, we find that right If the answer is something we can, you know, bear down on, then, hey. Let's let's do it. So Right. And I I guess the other question, and this is you know, the other piece, which is teachers say they want all sorts of shit, but don't end up using putting more little bells and whistles in a lot of things, but it you know, sure. I love that. It is it's very different than I'm gonna use it. Exactly. And why we need somebody like Betsy Peters. To be like you know, who works with startups who are, like, dead focused on like teachers, like don't use it. Forget it. Tomorrow, we're doing this instead. Right? Who's like, don't I don't care if you like it. Right? You know what? Right. Mean, I I think I would sure. That would be great. But will I really use it? What we find so often is you know, a future is like this. Let's make it. And then, you know, very few teachers use it. Right. Even the people who were telling you have to use it. Right. Yep. So that that's where being that's where trying to figure out if there is some startup mentality notion or something to be had within some of the stuff that we're doing to try to say, oh, we're more sure that the stuff we're doing will have impact when we're done. That's part of the goal. That's the answer to your discovery piece. It's like if we can find that in more things in more places, including in the first year of a funded project or the only year of a funded project, whatever, then all the better. And I think I'm and I'm more interested in, like, the market impact of this versus, like, know, I think it would be helpful to get more grants I think. I don't know because I don't know what foundations are looking for. I think, you know, I've really like the corporate sponsorship idea. This doesn't really seem to fall into that. I'm hoping that we can get sponsors for stuff we already have and, like, maintenance and tweaks, not like a whole new thing. Mhmm. So then you know, I'm hoping these user questions head us down the path where, like, the teachers also wanna book but more importantly than the teachers wanting it, is that we can sell it to some Mhmm. Publisher or partner or something down the road. And so yeah. Yeah. It's it's like a constant worry of mine. You know? It's Yep. Right. It's it's constant worry being more Muddy. Right. Yeah. That's your job. Yep. Right. Literally your job. Yep. Uh\-huh. But I and this is, again, sort of a very practical you know, what we have and where we get money as opposed to what can we make to get money. Right. Yeah. Different Oh, totally. Yeah. Also also the the, you know, I I I've been here you know, since the Jurassic, and I cannot tell you how many times I'm know, a teacher, it would be so great, and we go and do and find teachers use it kind of thing. Like, how careful we have to be to not listen to the one Yes. Yeah. You know? Exactly. The one place. No. And that's why I'm saying, and I think Leslie was saying, let's do it. And with the open side, I'd be these are just these are little bubbles and glimmers and some things that we need to ask more questions of and see, like, there is there a resonance there or not. Well, and and The other question is people and or to what we That's why that's when you get who does user discovery and make sure you're not know, you know, that that is really easy to hear stuff that you wanna hear and to stuff you don't wanna hear. Exactly. And that's that's why I keep on saying we need to learn how to listen with this stuff. And also did you ask the same where were your questions for the unified tool? Yeah. We did we didn't we winged it. So so So, like Yep. Don't have apples to apples if we're apples. No. Of course not. Collaboration. That was just funny. Nope. Fine. It's like Yes. We're just going down a hundred different passes. That's a always had seven questions. Well, right. No. We're we are are doing the initial we're through these things. We're doing the initial discovery that would help us understand you know, what kinds of questions and I think within this, we might get four or five little glimmers and be like, oh, okay. We think those two or if there was something there, we could actually do something with it with variation on what we have or what have you. Can we learn more about that? Can we interview 30 people for fifteen minutes each about something around collaboration or around AI? Don't know what it is. And then start to see if we see commonalities in that, and then we can get some better sense. So so are you and Leslie checking your biases? Yes. Is what we're saying? Yeah. You know, I think that I'm not hearing, and any of your conversations are I good one of the content or a good one of you know? And so it just Mhmm. Yeah. Well, and as you've said before too, Chad, we all think of African lions, people use it. Mhmm. So why do we ask why don't use Right. Yeah. Because maybe there's a corporate sponsor Anyway, the things they're describing are exactly what I'm, you know, what I'm saying I think we could benefit from getting a little bit better at. And I think we would benefit disproportionately by getting a little bit better at learning how to check our learning how to listen for those signals, learning how to know that they're not just one person, and reinforce them in some way. And even if that's just now we have more confirmation that this is an important proposal idea, The likelihood of the proposal coming out with something people care about and want is higher. And if it's we go to the foundation and say, We've got a signal here. We think we might be able to develop this into a thing, but we need startup seed money. We've got evidence for it. So all those things are positive. You know, the only the only downside is the opportunity cost of the time investment. We need be a little bit careful about not asking 20 questions. But Right. Right. Right. Yeah. And I'm not saying this is No. No. It was just sort of You're totally asking the right questions. Do you know, I'm on suicide with this. You know? What's the best way to invest our time to you know, with what we have versus what we're gonna need. Yep. And Yep. And, you know, I'm assuming Danielle is gonna start with what we're gonna need in a lot of ways, Like, you know, like, give us money to do more Mhmm. As opposed to what we already have. And so I think Unless she's not. Unless she says, oh my god. You have 17 amazing products. Like, I I don't know. I don't know that that's a starting. Point. Maybe she comes in like Rick. Like I said, like, demos that I've done, he was like, oh my god. They're amazing. And he he he literally been through the our resource page we have. He was page Florida Tech or not. 10 resources, 12 resources. I can see a sponsor for that. I can see a sponsor for that. I can see Mhmm. So what if that is the lowest what if that happens to be the lowest hanging fruit? And she says Which is fine. I too have, like, unwide eyed, and I can see his sponsorship. With that. It is existing stuff, not new stuff. Know. I would already say No, I'm not it's bothand as well. And if that existing stuff gets us, you know, $500,000 of which we need 200 k to maintain something, and we've got some extra time, you know, question is why was that so interesting to people, and can we do more with that something, and what might we do next. Right? Yeah. Because stuff does exist. We can get some money right now, and profit off a bit to get us to the next stage or to do the next cool thing. That teachers want. Great. Mhmm. Completely. Alright. So that was brief and long and useful. What was Betsy Peterson say? So you emailed her, but are you going to hire? I emailed her. I'm going to have a conversation. I'm gonna bring these concerns and ideas to the conversation with her. I'll bring Kiley in if we, you know, align in terms terms of timing. And so I'm not the only person, you know, filtering this. But the goal would be to say, we're in this place where we've got a lot of stuff and we know we're really good at NSF, but we'd like it to have more impact and we'd like to have more different sources from things. And it's not exactly what you do, so she might be like, Yeah, not me, but talk to this person. Or it might be me for a month and I'll tell you if I'm gonna sign on or go away. But you know, then at least we've got somebody besides a mirror Yep. Exactly. Okay. So item number three is discussion. Well, that's new. Exactly. Which ones? I think we talked enough about those get what we need. Yeah. We're signed up and I'll reach out for the order. Table. Right? We're just at the table. We're signing up. We're gonna reach out to them. They're small. So C. Mhmm. And KST. Year candle and that was Yep. Right? Yes. Yep. That's focus focus group. That's the Alright. So the NSF changed things on Friday. Is the short version of it. Everybody is still a processing. We are still processing. To remind those who haven't been following every period in quotation mark, they retired a number or archived a number of solicitations like all of them pretty much, and put out one program call, which is not a solicitation for a specific proposal, but a call that says you can submit 15 page proposals to this broad set of ideas do what you think is right, They capped the amounts on those, up to $7\.50 for two years and maybe it's a one year cap. I forget. It's maximum two years. I needed to go back and look if they kept the total number of awards, essentially, it's 40 total awards right now that they have. Okay. Yep. It's like here's the snow money. Here's the Right. Yep. So maybe not a cap, but the expectation would works out to, you know, $3,400 k per award. On the level of what they're describing. And tilted largely to AI and emerging technologies. A little bit unclear about that something. They also put out out a Dear Colleague letter for supplementals for projects that have AI education or AI involvement in some way. That's a little bit unclear and that we should we can talk more about that. I don't know more about the details of that but it's a thing that we should be looking at each even first, I think. I talked to David Daniel, who is, nicely unorthodox and very open about everything. He's a program officer who's been there since whenever and doesn't care except as long he doesn't get fired before his two year, you know, vesting is up or whatever. But also it was he wants good things to happen in the world. He was a little bit polite like he often is. His general, like, yeah, that's the call. He was not saying necessarily that, you know, just wait a little bit longer and all of a sudden we'll revive all these other things. He also sort of said some of these things are in you know, congressionally mandated, so it's a little bit unclear. There was some vagary in that. So what coming out? Like he said DRK12 was going to send me to ours. I don't think it is. Eye test is, well, but some of these things get mandated in the calls for something. His take was that they expected the thinking at NSF was that there would be a continuing resolution. Because people wouldn't get around to we didn't talk about the details there. Which would on the one hand probably keep the budget high. On the other hand, said last time I was a CR, they didn't get budget numbers until like December. So it has this delaying effect. And then he talked somewhat philosophically, and I know his take on this in general, that research has had it really well for a long time. And he's like, SBE, talk to folks in SBE. They've gotten along with a lot less. And so resetting, he talked about in general there's a war on evidence, you know, and science at the same time, so there's lots of layers underneath this. He didn't know about you know, anything that's happening in grants and agreements. He said it's a black hole pretty much everybody. And so no new news there one way or another. And I said if there's more money what would happen? He said they wouldn't change the caps on awards. Because that wouldn't be fair to people who had proposed earlier. But congress comes out with more money, I think he said they might do more of same. Like, they might do put more money into this pool. Yeah. That's that's a short version that's probably bastardizing what he said, but of what I learned. I haven't talked to anybody else at NSF Mhmm. And also jives with the at least the last two new RPCs just came out don't have like, due dates. Mhmm. It's, like, rolling, submit, see how much money we have. We're not sure. When we'll get it or how much. One of them has has target dates. Right. At least get clusters of them to Size, by the way, has always done these. Size has been on these rolling calls forever. Geosciences, yeah. So lots of what do you call them? Groups within NSF have those. Do you have strategies for when to submit or are you just just get it in when you get it in? Right. I mean, you get it in when you get it in. And you know, the strategies usually are like, oh, they're likely to have money. You know? Whatever. But it's really they have to get enough in to then get a panel. So could be months. It could be five months before you hear anything, you know, that kind of thing. So but but yeah, I mean, that's how the geoscience and the wildfire science was also sort of Mhmm. So they're moving that. Well, I think the education law moved that. Eventually. Too. Mhmm. Model. That model. Yeah. I think they have in this in this particular situation. Right. And it seems like they haven't changed anything about ATE undergraduate education at all. It's all k 12 that they're really cutting back on. Yeah. The interesting thing he said about CORE, and I should go back and parse this, he said You can still propose to CORE if and I don't know if he meant if you want to do K\-twelve or core has to be K\-twelve, but he said you have to use undergrads as your test subjects for the K\-twelve ideas or something, which was interesting. So I'm not I quite parse that closely. That's strange. I was interpreting it saying if you have a K12 core idea, do it under this Anything that's k 12 Right. Should be in this RF. Yeah, think that's true. Mhmm. Right. So so, I mean, this is huge. Mhmm. It's a huge thing for Concord. Yep. Because you know, the size of the grounds are not sustainable, especially if you ever have partner. Mhmm. You know? Like, you could do a one year grant for you know, 350\. But that's all us all the time. And so I think a strategy is you know, again, how do we do that? Right. If we do that, you know, kind of thing, until until we understand whether, you know, things are gonna evolve. And and I mean, as we remember way back in whenever they used to have calls just not fund them. Mhmm. When there was a a a point in time where it's like, you can apply, but we're not giving any money out, really. Like like, they've had this kind of shrinkage. Right. And he said that's why they pulled these other solicitations so they didn't get lots of people writing for Right. Their k twelve, and they couldn't fund it. So it's just a CR, does that you know? Do you think they'll just expand the current thing? I mean, right. If there's a CR, I don't know, and I don't know if they have to work under the things that were mandated or not. He said congress doesn't really push those, but they're mandated in that if Congress got their act together and got something out the door, it's got Senate one has a number of things specifically listed, including nasal, so they might need to respond to that maybe. I'm talking about how the Senate has been released. Trying to be more specific about how the money has to be spent so there's less Mhmm. Discretion. At the administrator. Mhmm. Right. In the deep state. Yes. Right. From from you know, why that's really. Right. Deciding. Right. I'll be right back. My interpretation of the senate was so that they can negotiate with house and get it back, basically. To about where the CR would be if they actually could negotiate because they were, like, upping it so that they could kinda come back. Mhmm. Which feels like you know, the NSF has chosen to actually handicap the k 12\. What do medication prematurely. Right. Yeah. That was I think some of the level of concern. Mhmm. So so far, they're known and been five Doctor 12\. This year. Five. Mhmm. Cynthia passed more girlfriend yesterday. Oh, good. It's my obsession is to download these damn files. I just have a word search, like, dubbing. Over. Yep. I mean, there is so so there is the other one that, you know, I'm I'm in theory trying to write for September. Eleventh. That other future core Mhmm. Which is a is similar in size. You know, it's up to $1,000,000\. Mhmm. Three or four years. But they're they plan hundred to six hundred awards. Well, across. That's that's the entire size call. Yes. It's there's like 10 divisions. It's it's computer science. Yeah. Comes down You end up you know, if you divide it by 10, it's still 40\. To 60\. So I guess it's another thing like that. But it's just kind of amazing that, like, that grouping that's, you know, $600,000,000 Mhmm. In k twelve education it's $30,000,000\. Yeah. Yeah. Well This is kind of you know, and you'd think the k twelve would have its own set of ten. Mhmm. It should have, like, 600,000,000 and four hundred awards. Yeah. Sure. Like that. But education for all of us. Bad. Mhmm. Right. But I do think that, you know, we've been beyond the education for opportunities division of NSC. Because it's mandated education as part of all of these other things with that looks like, but I don't know Again, you know, it just feels like, one big question is is is it worth it to go after a one year $300,000 thing, and can we come up with things that are just conquered? Mhmm. So I have some key events ourselves, it's 15 of us. Right. Well, I mean, can submit as many things as you want. We can that's right. But if you if you submitted three ideas, because there's no limit on them. Right. Well, Dan, that's five Well, I want those stuff to be submitted. Do wanna talk about it. I have, like, a proposal plan for four of the things that have now been Yes. Consolidating. Right? Yep. So should I be submitting four? That seems crazy. Right. Well I'm not gonna get probably even one. Well, we so we should we should be submitting proposals. So, you know, no question we should be submitting proposals because you know, this is funding that we know. To be clear, 300 k per year for a proposal is normal. Right? So, actually this is normal funding levels with a lot more proposal work a lot more proposal churn. It's not like the proposal values for us would be less than they might normally be. So So there's no part Right, assuming there's no partners, but realize that it's a program call So you propose what you want to do. And his, you know, David Daniels' take was like, put your thing in the context of where the transition of this idea would be in terms of scaling. You're not trying to do everything. He said, you know, pick a lane. In terms of where your idea is over time. And right. And he said stay there and you know except for in small bites. Right. Exactly. And he said indicate where it would go. Said tells people, a lane, put your blinkers on, like show where you would go next. You're not doing that. You're not trying to do RCT or everything. He was like, RCT was silly to begin with. So there's not a reason we can't be proposing things that are all us and things only we could do. There's going be a lot of AI slop, which is definitely true, like anybody who spell GPT is going to put it in there. Doesn't mean that they know how to do it, doesn't mean that they know what REG even means or that know how to propose it whatever. Like, there are lots of things that we can put out there. It does say emerging technologies too. Like, there will be well, we can decide. But, you know, there will be lots of things that there'll be people who can't propose to this at all. Like, we we're like, oh, I would But when you read it, like, there are lots of people whose work doesn't even fit that bill. Because technology is not the main thing they do. So there's I mean, they might be trying to use JTPT in whatever they're doing, but we can come in saying solid X, Y, and Z technology. So there are opportunities for us in it that are meaningful and real. And we shouldn't be ignoring that by any means, I think. There's also some you know, talking with them, she's like, we have 57% overhead. Like, take that off the top, and there's nothing left for us to do Mhmm. Mhmm. So it might discourage Mhmm. Right. Mhmm. You know we aren't particularly good about one year one year projects, Right. So if we propose, I figure a thousand dollar Good. That. Sufficient finishing them in one year. Do we put anything in one year? We do not like, what tell me what last one year project that finished in one year. Hasn't been one. There was Yeah. Uh\-huh. Yeah. Fire? Uh\-huh. Is that the one you did with the other guy? You did that with one year. Memorial Forest At Stellen? Yeah. But you were were you were subaboard? But, I mean, that's an example. We believe we're gonna make the simulation. We're gonna give to 12 teachers, and we're gonna write a report. Like, that was it. Right. Yep. We could do it. So that's an example that we really need to follow for ourselves. I think being probably a and you. Because you, you know, you're like this. B being a sublime board, is probably puts a little more pressure on us to deliver. Possibly or Not in this case, but, I mean, it really was being clear what we were delivering. Yes. As mom's saying That's the thing. We're gonna Right. Mhmm. Knew I think that that it is doable. And, you know, and you know, the difference is you know, not saying we're gonna get all the results and research it and be able to write 12 papers. Right? You know, that kind of thing. You know? Like, if it also built on some Right? You had the wildfire explorer simulation. We have it. No. It was completely new simulation. I'll ultimately. But, you know, it built on the fact that we had expertise on doing a simulation that was similar and that the the scientists would like to do do. At different stuff. Mhmm. Right? And so, you know, I I think that it's not trivial to to imagine what a bite sized technology piece is that can be done in a year that includes working into the classroom also or whatever. But I know, I I think but in this is like as a model. And, like, if we are gonna do that, looking at, like Yeah. You talking about four for that one. That was a 150\. Total. Okay? Yeah. For just doing the simulation and and having told teachers use it and writing a report. Right? Like, that's like a research the word. Research. Trial. It was under the wildfire call. Right? So they're they're like, oh my god. We're gonna get it out to other people other than just ourselves. You know? Like, they were so excited. Mhmm. But, you know, it it know, so it was we have to understand in this what I don't understand about the current call is we were research and development, and and now are we development with the blinkers to research? Are we Right. Research with the blinkers? To know? We need to ask that question. We need to find our lane in a way that's differentiated to from others. Like, so there are secret sauces, you know, leads to some degree. And the other thing that and this is a little bit more of David Daniels' take than everything but you know, when he was talking about the ad research, it's had its you know, the bloated day or whatever, you know, he was like, important not interesting. He's like, Find the things that are important, and do those things, and there's not going to be room for the things that are just you know, cool. So I think what's the rationale? What's the case that you're making? And how do we think about that grain size? But nobody's going to be able to do a five year research project in this something. So nobody's going to do research. So it may be a case where we're actually able to call a spade a spade and say, we're gonna make a really amazing prototype and see if there's opportunity for that something. Our output from this is what might the research questions be if you were to do something like this all explore exploratory, maybe. The the the the their review. To say, because the the three years now it has been Mhmm. You know, NSF does research It doesn't do well. Right. Mhmm. It's all focused around the research questions. Right. And and it's all focused around researchers evaluating that you didn't do the RCT. Right? You know, in But they do have exploratory categories. And you can look to those and, you know, model after that and be explicit that you're modeling after it. I'm not saying it's only that, but I mean one million exploratory? Yeah. Okay. OptiVi. Right? So propose up to him. Well, I think Right. Oh, wonderful. Oh. That's a different story, maybe. Yeah. Is the name. Yeah. July? 7 Yeah. Okay. 750? Yes. Yeah. Development and early stage research. You know? Use inspired yada yada. Right? Mhmm. I mean, to you That's Yeah. I did I think I don't know. Reading the tea leaves here until we actually submit stuff and find out what they're funding. I mean, they'll know the academy. Won't. But, you know, like, that was a one year. Like, okay. We're gonna tweak them. This stimulation. We're gonna teach teachers and good luck with it. You know? Not you know, like, they're they're they're not foundation. I mean, it's kind of focus. It's not doing everything. And so I don't know. It does it's a rethink, and you're right. It's like who are they gonna have? Who's gonna review it? It's a bunch of researchers. That's who they are tagging to. To review things. Right? They're getting everybody from university. I mean, Yeah. But, again, you know, again, who's gonna be able to do research in a way that is also novel and emerging technology and what have you and is plausible. You know, you'll get a few Chateappity ones, and then you'll get other ones that can't do something. And so if you can come in and say, here is a surprising thing that we could actually do that would get something interesting in a year and a half. You know, I think there's a a for that probably. Saying we shouldn't try that. I'm just saying I know. I'm I'm not arguing against it. The panel. Right. They're they're packed with research. Mhmm. Mhmm. You know, unless they're told, know, someone can propose something now where they're not the whole thing isn't a round just doing a research for it. Mhmm. So those are some of the questions. To write a concerned research. We knew how to do it ten years ago. That's for sure. Whatever Amy wrote for the well, it's in some words. So whatever part was sort Concord focused or your statement of work focused or whatever, looking at that, about what how that sold. Mhmm. That got through. I think, again, that was not a It wasn't I know. Education. Right. True. I think one silver lining of this for me is that it makes Danielle's job a little easier. Right? Like, we're, like, chunking him down where foundations really are. That's true as well. Focused. Mhmm. So we could repurpose for that as well. That's mhmm. Less mhmm. Yeah. Less I'm concerned about how much writing is gonna go into this smaller you know, return on investment, But maybe it's a I mean, it's it's more riding every again, it's more riding every year. It's, you know, the the overall yield obviously, is, you know, is smaller. We don't know how much the pool of people is gonna reduce. I think it won't reduce proportionately, but it will reduce to some degree, especially given that universities know that just waiting for the 15% shoe to drop too. That people may not be able to apply on that regard, and we bound by that. Like, that's We're still in Massachusetts. We're not in cores. So those are other things too. Like, how many are they going to give Good question. I don't know. I don't know if they care about that necessarily. Yeah. I thought they do, but we we did it. They're they're highlighting them in the webinar for future core. It was a big deal. I did chat GPT analysis of things that have been funded so far since May, and it was It was one of the sort of themes asked Chad GBT to look at themes across the abstracts. Mhmm. And it said, EBSCORE. Interesting. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. I mean, this chocolate. Know, the one I'm trying to put together for future core were like, working hard to figure out how we can like, get a budget that splits across Concord, MSU, and Alabama. Mhmm. Mhmm. Yep. My Sorry. So I mean, yeah, obviously it's different thinking. I don't I mean, don't think it's as different for us as it feels, I think it's a little bit I think that shift is less for us. For others perhaps. The difference is going to be are we going to do arm wrestling to figure out who's going to So that's part of the interesting question is that's a different conversation, but okay. But, you know, it's I am I'm really frustrated. Because I was very excited like I Yep. All these things that I wanna submit for. Mhmm. Yeah. Well, our friends at Michigan, that's great. They wanna submit they wanted to submit the DRK 12\. Resend it. The DRK 12\. They will be able to Well, right. Forget that. What's was gonna mail you on the side and say we shouldn't be bothering at that time. It'd be before this, but yeah. Even before this, but The biggest question is you know, splitting up three ways becomes not doable in many ways for me. You know? And and I think that's the piece of trying to understand. I mean, it it's it feels very dog eat dog world right now, and it Mhmm. I don't you know, like, that's the part I don't quite understand. Yeah. I agree. I mean we have to we definitely have to think about what kinds of things fit and then make careful choices about it. It's certainly not a place where we're starting by calling up for people to be partners on one idea. That's for sure. And if we can find things that are plausible for us to do alone, I think we should start with those. I think there are those things. And I think we can find things that are this grain size, seven fifty for usis not that different than what we're used to. With the DCLs that it needs we do a color we know the size of those, or are those also So those are supplementals. So 300 suggested by 20%. Original. Yep. So those are those are me and in my view, like, that's what we should be talking about yesterday morning at 9AM because we have least a handful of things that are ready for that. You know, Jay is on vacation this week, but she has two that she should be talking to Wu He about yesterday. Data by Voice should be talking about that. Leslie, AJ wants to talk about that tomorrow, a supplemental. Mhmm. Right. Which I think makes sense if you can convince the person it's we don't right now have a lot of overlaps in program officers. Jay's got two with Wu He, but we don't have other people who have Wu He. You've got Leila, who we know. Which oh, the the the the what's the data flow? The brain waves? The yeah. The one was the one with Boston College. Right. Uh\-huh. But that would be BC talking to them, not us. Yes. And Bostik is the Inscriptions one, and I think another one of ours internally So that's an advantage as well that we're not all talking not going to one program and going down the line and saying, how about these six supplementals necessarily? That's it? So I have a new one who doesn't know what she's Yes. Exactly. Apparently, I wrote any day. Oh, really? Yes. So That's interesting. Right. Okay. She might already be like, hey. I want So these are supplemental for ones that already have AI going. It's unclear. I mean, I think if you said AI in the proposal it's clear, in my view, you should be talking to these folks. I think if you are doing AI or AI ish stuff probably also more than that I don't think we know beyond that piece. But that definitely is leaning on that. I mean, looked at the Eastway proposal. You can't find it there, but maybe there's something that is in that direction that might be worth it. I don't know. Yeah. Just started curious whether AI was the necessary Well, I haven't reparsed it, but when I was looking at it the first time, it looked like that was what they're looking at. AI, it like the stretch is not AI in not only AI and computer education, like, not only Jay's thing, could also be using AI in other ways. It felt like But we should read it again because I may have missed four different things in it too. Yeah, we do have apologies. Yeah. Which for this particular Point is Leila. Yeah. What I don't understand here is like, I mean, should I be encouraging Ito to go after more dollars because the program that we're working on fits squarely within these parameters. Or not because it's a new grant that don't even have the contract for you. You should be talking to the oh, well, if have a contract for the different story, but if there's a grant that hasn't ended, that's when you get a supplemental. Got one. You know? Did he? Right. But, you you've got several that are coming in that have AI in there Yeah. That's it too soon. Well, I don't think you can get a supplemental for something that's not awarded. Well, once we get a word, like, it's gonna work or not. Right. October, let's write the supplemental immediately because Yeah. I mean, they don't love that. This is a different world than usual. But, you know The brain waves is that's what you're talking about. Let's is is not a new grant. And it's not talking about the Yeah. I'm I'm not. I'm not. Talking about the follow on. Right. His brain waves Yeah. Done. We got, like, no caustic extension. Okay. She Yeah. He had no cost extension. Okay. Yeah. He had money that he was trying to wrestle away from the University of Connecticut. It took a year. Alright. Right? But but they finally got it, and now he just has to you know, release a sub award to us. Okay. Yeah. I can't spend all this in the, you know, four months that I've got left. Uh\-huh. So you know Well, it's on the as we have conversations, it's worth thinking about anything that even comes you know, casts a shadow on that notion of AI or whatever just because that's money that's sitting there, the equivalent of one of these proposals. That's a one pager and a conversation with a PO, that's sitting there waiting. And if there's a PO who's on your side, then we should not be leaving it on the table. The middle of Thursday next week? Well, I'd mean, I think the goal for next week is a little bit of both end. I mean, some of that we don't necessarily need to talk about as a group, but so we should be having those DCL conversations as soon as we possibly can anyway. Mhmm. I think Thursday next week is a combination of some sharing of what we're interested in for Danielle to hear and for all of us to hear. And the beginning of this sort of strategic conversation about how do wewe hopefully will know a little bit more through the grapevine or have had some other conversations with POs by that point so that we know what we know and don't know and can at least start to say, Okay, can't submit 40, but we shouldn't submit two to this thing. I think the ATE That's a good question. It's October, isn't it? Should be definitely thinking about that. Very much so, I think. Is there going to be a structured to that Thursday meeting? Far as, like No. You mean time time wise? You mean? Say, like, you know, yes. Let's have time for people to express their ideas and interests and whatnot. But, like, you know Right. Is there going to be a a structured strategy moving forward of should be submitting x number of proposals. To this, that, and this here's the cat, the dollar amount cat. Like, I would all of that information can be laid out for people. So I think I mean, I think as much as we know, which is I think we can we will start with our sort of on the ground interpretation of what the call is and what we think it means for us. I mean, at least know an order of magnitude of proposals that we can put in we'll have a sense of what the balance might be. You know, how many 300, how many seven fifties, kind of thing, and so that we're not all expecting we're gonna submit 25 ideas. Right. And it feels like a long enough meeting. By the end of that meeting if if if there's some general understanding of the calls for proposals. You know, Chris Moore spits out an idea. Amy spits out an idea. Dan spits out an idea, and it's okay. Well, that one falls in this category, so I wanna on that? You know, kind of like, it's there going to be some kind of to the PIs? I think we're I think we're gonna need to make sure that we're not overlapping with ourselves whether the ideas can germinate and grow to that degree within an hour, an hour and a half, is, you know, unclear. But I think we'll get a sense of those categories and can try to not compete with ourselves. Yeah. So homework is Leslie. Everybody needs to read that RFP very carefully. Alright. Put out some guidance in advance. And then I guess the other longer term? Particular question, is you know, there's gonna be proposal writing. There's gonna be whatever Danielle's focusing or whatever this other person may be focusing. Is this person involved? Right. So that's the other long term conversation. I mean, we will be as of Monday, a smaller organization. And one that, you know, this group has been sort of prepping for that transition. And so I think we need to think differently about how we meet as an organization. And, you know, I mean, if we get proposals that are in the hopper, then we'll have more people who have got existing projects too. So, you know, so I think, yes, this group needs to evolve. And I think we also will have some smaller working I mean, I've already said we have a subgroup of people who just wanna cultivate the PD question forward, that's, you know, a handful of people. It doesn't have to be me. The discovery thing is gonna branch a little bit. We'll need to keep our arms around it, but I think that's somewhat of a separate conversation than obviously the proposal one. And I think there will be grander, conquered conversations that should involve, you know, everybody or large subsets of people that we have been mostly having in this room. So very open to input and thoughts on exactly how to do that because I don't think it means seven standing meetings. But it should not mean we're just sitting in a room and not telling anybody about, I mean, the organization. Could fit the organization in this room if we had to. Now Yeah. At this point. So I just think in my opinion, there needs to be direction on what those working groups are and not an open call for what are people think they should get involved. But right now I agree. If it's the focus of here's the here are opportunities for revenue streams or funding Right? There's, you know, Danielle's work with foundations and corporate sponsors. There's proposal writing. To MSF. Or whatever else exists. In the world and then you know, there's the PDP user discovery. Like, those seem like great categories to have subsets of people working independently also reporting. Back. To the larger organization on progress made. Like, I don't think we need to go more than that. I don't think so either. Definitely not. It's more than enough. Have as of next week like, that's the type of direction that people need. Like Mhmm. Yes. We've been meeting for several months. This of people have been sitting around the table trying to figure out what these next steps are. Here's what we're pursuing. Yep. Who wants to work in each of these categories? Mhmm. Yeah. Who do we think might be good. Fits for each of these categories, and let's have a look next week. This group meeting, the idea is to talk about sort of what we've done. Yeah. And it's already gonna be in those group. But the right. The the yeah. A lot it's definitely an identified area. Yeah. I think, you know, complication is organizing going forward. Yeah. Our first all hands or our first whatever come together as a group. After Yep. Layoff? Yep. People next week is warrants that type of direction of, like, yes. We're a smaller group. Here's our here's where the driving response is. Yep. Exactly. The complicate the complicated thing with you know, and what I would love, well, for lots of reasons, it would be that have the proposals that are in the hopper, you know, clear in a word because I think part of the question is, like, our saying, Oh, you thought your year one was X. It's actually partially that and partially all this stuff. So there's a little bit of cart and horse, whatever. We just gotta push through it. Yeah. But that but that I we're prestaging that notion too that, like, as we have time and energy to do things, part of what we're doing is organizational stuff. Right? Right. I know. Think that's that's irrelevant whether it might be Yeah. You will be working on this this other strand of organizational work as part of your job Exactly. Yep. As part of your project I mean, I just Yep. Being clear about how to sort of frame it and say it. As a you know, as you're charging data by voice, you're thinking about how you could do Barely even. Like, all one project. Like, we are working on stuff. Yeah, know. Susan. Totally. Somebody's still gonna look at those timesheets. Yep. Totally know. Yep. And we should with that, we should think about a reporting structure for all of these things. You know, I have been fascinated see every one of Rick's documents, like, and here's the reporting structure, and here's the reporting structure, and here's the board report, and here's the CEO report, and here's the blah blah blah. I don't think we need 72 reports out of each committee, but I think that we should have Yes. All all hands reports and Mhmm. Right. And I think, you know, I think the the way to reinforce what you're describing is that the all hands meetings evolve into at least partially, if not wholly, status reports on the organizational efforts. Here are the three things that we're doing. We're working on proposals. Yeah. But we're also working on news discovery, working on PD So people even if they're not at the table in all three of those groups, most of the people won't be, right? They know that that's what we are doing. Is that work. Yes. Oh, yeah. No. I'm not just that. Bullet Totally. Yeah. But but as as as clear, you know, there needs to be somebody who continues to push the effort. Yes. For each of these subgroups. Mhmm. And so the reporting is also sort of accountability, if you will, that you guys are actually doing some work. And Yeah. Was just gonna say, like, in the same regard that Danielle has a list of deliverables in the first three months. Like, know, I think it would be whether it's a group effort as a part of this group Yep. Or Chad. Mhmm. You give your first draft, and then we talk about it. Yep. Like, within each of those categories, you know, by December, Right. Targets groups would have done goals. Yes. Yes. And even if it's just one thing, right? I mean, you're gonna put people in some of these subgroups that maybe have not talked about it. Right. Yet. We think that would be good fit. Or maybe they're just interested in participating. They might not have any clue to start. So we do need be jumping off. Points. And things to hold people accountable. For. Right? Like what are you working towards? Yeah. First. It's not just oh, you're interested in You're doing that do that thing and tell me about it. Yeah. Let us know what you find out. Exactly. Like, it's more of Yep. Yeah. Well, maybe that's where this I think that's morphs to is we're the ones that, like, know what the agenda is or setting the agenda and making sure the groups are moving. Well, I think part of goals. Think part of the thing within you as we're, you know, the sharing where we stand is you know, we can come up with the first best, you know, idea of, like, what do we think success might look like by December 4 that effort. Right? Yeah. And that's really what we need. Also short term thing to milk out. Question about next Thursday's ideation meeting. Since the RFP that we're really talking about doesn't have deadlines, Mhmm. You're no longer writing for a DRT. Twelve two zero on the fourth. Right. How do we say to people Well, that's the other expectation setting. Line, Right. Most people That's right. That's the other expectation setting is we need to get these in ASAP. Concord has ASAP. Because we run out of money. Right. Exactly. Right. Like, so we But for but for this for this where it's wide open, open, like, we we're gonna need to really push ourselves in a way that we're not used to. I think a really important thing. You know? Like, not only if if you're gonna move forward, choose you get you get the October. You get the November. You get December, and you have to because you know, especially if you're doing more than one or whatever. But but I do think that yeah, you you mess up You you don't get the support because we're moving on to another one kind of thing. Yeah. Do think days between my time, Lisa's time. There's Susan thinking about five days of on this person or day ten day or whatever. Right. Right. All of those sorts of of things. And is this month better than next month? But also, just the strategy of the sooner The sooner, the better. If we could submit for next week, would be because is that a good strategy? Right. In which case, is it better when they're gonna say Right. Exactly. Yep. Four weeks. I don't know. Mhmm. Well, it's also good. Say you should expect you know, we are planning to, and you should expect to hear something within six months. Mhmm. Sounds good. But they also said well supposed to get funded. You know, they they get their money sort of. In pieces, and there might be a whole bunch they get in the first round that they can only fund half of what they wanna fund, so then the other half will will stay in the hopper. Well, on this program call, it says, you know, encouraged by December 5\. Right? So or else, you know, pending additional funds. Right. So which really probably means you know, November 1, you know, at the latest. Yeah. Think it's in the program called Not the DCL. I forget. There was something that said December 5, maybe it's the DCL. Maybe that's the supplemental. It might have been. I'm not sure. December 5 sounds good to me. Yeah. But I would say December 5 is not a deadline. Like, that's way too late. You know? Probably we're saying October 2, you know, or something like that because just sooner the better. Well, supplemental supplemental is like September 15\. I think. You know? But the regular proposals, even then, like, I think if we're submitting at Thanksgiving, we're getting the dregs of what's around or you don't get on the panel you want or something. Or I mean, it's just if this is the only shot, right, let's go. So you already have dates in your head. I think we have Right. So I think And I so I think I think it's the dates in the head. I think it's the numbers of proposals. And I think, know, and we need to come to the table with a sort of calendar and spread. Exactly. That's where Danielle can be helpful. I mean, I know we have her solidly in the foundation thing, but we're a small group. But she can also write her down the federal proposals too. Doesn't need to be involved. Yeah. I don't know. Yes. I I think I think I need to keep that machine going ourselves. We're used to it. The other one. Question is Yeah. And this is week. Like, because I need to be working on proposals. Right. How much effort is you know? And so we need to start figure out who's also helping Danielle with getting foundation proposals or whatever. Like, those are equally time consuming and whatever. So Yep. So you know, like that will also have to evolve. Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah. And I think next week's meeting ends up Chad, Sue, Rick, I have a meeting with her in the following. Monday, like, the Monday after she starts so September 8 or something. Basically, like, lay out what type of support is she going to need. Like, is she gonna just, like, does she just ride solo on this you know, to begin with? I mean, I don't think she does, but understanding, like, the PIs and hearing about the proposals that are going in. Right. Or I think would have I would certainly expect that, and we were telling this, I would certainly expect that it's not you know, a PI needing to sit with Danielle for four hours on a given foundation proposed, especially these are letters of intent. It's something like as the conversation comes in, moves along. So I think she'll be able to have a conversation with you get a handful of ideas that she can look around and sort of match up with clinicians, maybe come back for a pitch notion. But I don't think it's like, Oh, now you've got to stop everything and write seven pages for Danielle tomorrow. I think also I I would not underestimate the amount of time we should be giving Danielle to make her successful. Right. That you know, we're we're needing to not be leading on what the idea is other than here's stuff. You know? How do we mold it to me? But then we should really think about how we are working her to make her successful. Mhmm. So I would be a little cautious about thinking that because I think over time, we can actually Oh, you're That's fair. Right. Pulling back. But I I feel like it would be shocking to me to have somebody come in and, ah, have a quick hour conversation, and I'll be able to write something. You know? Like Mhmm. You know? So so let's you know, like, that's a balance between what ideas come out of proposal. And then as ideas come from her, you know, how do we balance the the and staff to be able to support. Yeah. That's that's fair. To get to. We may be thinking narrow mindedly about what foundations support means. Like, if Mhmm. The conversation that's happening now is is assuming that foundation support is exactly what an NSF grant proposal looks. Right? There are there's foundation for business development. There's foundation support Right. You know? There's foundation support saying, look, we've got this awesome thing. We want to do in, you know, Kentucky. You know, or what have you. So adventure and haven't been able to it or update it in a very long time. Know? It's Mhmm. It's not necessarily so been proposal to an In fact it's In fact, it probably isn't. It probably very infrequently is. We've got this blue sky idea that, you know, we want you to fund from the ground up necessarily. Yeah. So we'll see. Right. Right. Absolutely. But but But you're also you're also right that expecting that in day three, she's gonna know our company is probably not fair. Know how to talk about the company. Consortium. There are some lang you know, there's some language that exists. Uh\-huh. But then but I'm wondering if I have the chance to know what you talk about. Yep. Very much. We are Yep. That too. Right? But I I was also department head of the department. That doesn't exist, so the issue is to find additional people to help Yes. Uh\-huh. Right. Yeah. Right. I mean, all sorts of things that she will all just need to bill her, but, of Yes. Right. So you know, think she's gonna just just Totally fair. Totally fair. I don't need to send you. We gotcha. Alright? Got me. Alright. Thank you all for lots of good things. Thanks, Leslie. Enjoy.
