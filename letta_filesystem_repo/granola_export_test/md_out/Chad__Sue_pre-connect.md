Transcript:

Me: Hi.

Them: I don't wanna have this conversation when we're having other

Me: I know. I know.

Them: I'm just not my brain's not powerful enough to do this.

Me: My brain is yes. Exactly. You're flipping flipping all over the place. I agree. Yeah. I mean, the thing that the thing that is tuning my head on this one is just like, just myself saying, like, we've made the mistake of hiring people, the wrong people before. And it sucks. For years and years and years it sucks.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So, like, I don't care what situation like, like, there are companies where you would just be like, hey, I'm sorry. Like, I mean, in some version of that, we're doing, you know, maybe lightly and maybe a little kinder, but, like, essentially, that's the the places where you're like, Hey, you know what? After six weeks, you're not cut off with this job. We don't have to sit

Them: Yeah.

Me: that, but we don't have to be like, oh, yeah. Well, I guess no. No. That's crap. You know? And and we we get stuck in horrible positions for years in ways that, you know, suck our time and energy.

Them: Yeah. I yeah. I was wondering if there was any different sentiment now that things have changed. But I think I mean, for me, I don't think she's a good

Me: No. No. She she she is not she's a horrible hire. You know? Exactly. No no question. Exactly.

Them: hire. She's taken so much time from Lisa, and I recently And

Me: Exactly.

Them: but I also think that we and even though we have all this great news today,

Me: Yeah.

Them: The mathematics you know, if we if we relied on our old

Me: Yeah.

Them: business model, the mathematics it doesn't work.

Me: Right. I mean, I think we can definitely say that. I mean, like and we know that, like,

Them: With her. Yeah.

Me: if there's a case where we really well, think part of its story is you know, it's she's already seen that it's that the the picture of funding and staffing is a complicated one and can feel contradictory at times. The fact that we get money doesn't necessarily translate into all of a sudden everybody's got a position in the right places. And

Them: Right.

Me: organizationally, we really have to be looking at the

Them: Yep.

Me: at lots of those pieces and bouncing them for the long game here. And, so the fact that we get funding translates in its own way. But we're still in a place where we are looking to the year and years ahead in very calculated strategic fashion.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And we need to think about maintaining the sort of core organization now more than ever because there's still

Them: Yeah.

Me: more uncertainty than there is certainty in the world etcetera So, you know, that's the position we entered into this with were happy to you know, be able to receive this grant. In a way that kept that important work going through the end of the grant. And we knew in entering into that that we weren't even sure that that was gonna happen. But we knew that we couldn't guarantee continuing that beyond any more than we can guarantee anything more than the funding we have in hand for the organization.

Them: Yeah.

Me: We've got lots of energy that will you know, need to go into maintaining the core organization we have now and lots of strategic calculation that we need to be doing about how we can make things go forward, and we knew that as this position started. That we we wouldn't be able to support you know, additional people in that picture even as we're happy to support the grant you know, in this sort of

Them: Yeah.

Me: temporary finish out basis kind of thing. Well, I mean,

Them: Additional pic additional people. You mean,

Me: mean,

Them: Yeah.

Me: we are bringing her on for this grant. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we're, you know, that then we we're adding to the slate. You know, we're we're already would still even if the picture might look positive from the outside outside, we're still really taking care of that slate in ways that are not given.

Them: Yeah. Which is why we brought her on as a temporary employee and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: thought we had made it

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: clear what the parameters were. But, you know, now we'll make it

Me: What's the what happened and didn't happen yesterday afternoon, aside from it taking five times longer to say whatever you meant to say?

Them: she's getting better.

Me: Oh, that's good.

Them: Kathy, you mean?

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Alright.

Them: Or I'm getting better at saying, okay. We gotta move on. Nothing nothing. We we we just focused on the brass tacks stuff. She, talked about she said that she wants to go for future funding, obviously.

Me: Yep.

Them: And I said that we you know, we're really trying to figure out internally who is going for what right now, and, you know, that

Me: Yep. Yep. Yep.

Them: that's the one that, again, I'm like, we need to talk with Chad. Monday or, yeah, Friday.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Because she's going on vacation for a week, and

Me: Right.

Them: so that's good.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Or know, it is.

Me: Yep.

Them: What it is. For the most but it was, like, 99% speaking about the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: subawards that we're still wrestling with. So there wasn't really much teed up for this other than saying that we're really trying to match

Me: Okay.

Them: guys who

Me: Okay.

Them: funding opportunities and taking a deep look at that.

Me: So I think the upshot in see if we can say this while still saying clear, think the upshot is we wanted make clear and reinforce the sort of terms and assumptions that came with bringing on this project and this temporary basis to finish it out. Those assumptions are that we're happy to be at home for this project. But know, there's we knew that there's so much uncertainty in the world that we had to bring it and you on as a temporary employee because we couldn't really think about things going forward from there. So we see this project as as a home to run the project out But, you know, as we said when you were coming in, we're not able to support you know, further grant writing or extensions to this project. For a number of reasons strategically. I think, you know, it's not that we don't think the work is important and good. We think you've built some really good stuff. We'd be know, happy to help you think through how to work, for example, with Brau, to think about opportunities there or, you know, to, like, are there ways to extend this work quite possibly You know? And I think there might be other partners out there who are in a better position to to sort of bring that on. We just can't take that on ourselves right right now. I mean, I think something like that

Them: Yeah. I I think

Me: I don't know what to I don't know where to, you know, extend any branch or that just causes problems. Yeah. I know.

Them: Oh my god. I think we should encourage her to think about you know, her next steps, are not at Concord.

Me: What? Mhmm.

Them: She's hoping.

Me: Yep. Fine. Just let it go.

Them: And yeah, and and, you know, that that will will help with her next steps. Definitely not extending those grants. I would make it clear that we're that we're

Me: Yep.

Them: are having to be strategic You know, she's so specifically, she's interested in the supplemental and with Wu Hee Yeah. And, yeah, and make it clear that, like,

Me: Yes. Exactly. That, I think, we need to to shut down today. Yep.

Them: can only give so many supplementals per program officer, and we really need to extend

Me: Yep.

Them: Jay in particular, who's really begun funding this fiscal year And and yeah.

Me: Yeah. So, I mean, I think I think the I think the term is, you know, that

Them: Yeah.

Me: know you're asking about supplemental funding. Just wanna reiterate the terms that we you know, and the expectations we had coming in.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And, really, it's just about finishing up this grant. And, you know, if if it didn't come through to you, we're not able to extend as a temporary employee and sort of our policy for that either. The ability to write forward more grants or extend this work.

Them: Yep.

Me: And Specifically, when it comes to supplementals and things,

Them: Yes.

Me: we have to be really strategic. As an organization right now.

Them: Yep. I think that's it. I also wanted to say that I don't think it really Dawn she hasn't been in enough meetings where it was clear that everyone was going down to 80% as of

Me: Right.

Them: October 1 or she doesn't remember because it probably doesn't affect her personally. But I think we can say, we had a staff meeting where we reiterated to everyone that everyone was going down to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: 80%.

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: Even if all the grants came in. We had a huge grant

Me: Right.

Them: win yesterday, surprising. But still,

Me: Really we're really just you know, we're we're we're just

Them: mean, we don't have to yeah.

Me: making ends meet here right now and we happen to be very strategic about the choices that we make as an organization. So

Them: Yeah. I don't think we have to tell her that everyone's back up to whatever they want. I think we can leave that very vague.

Me: no. No. But but we're still like,

Them: Because we still don't

Me: Mhmm.

Them: we're still working that out. Yeah.

Me: Exactly. Yep.

Them: But I think sending that message to her that, like, we are just not out of the woods on this one.

Me: Yes. Exactly. No. I totally agree.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And which is what we tried to convey to her when we brought her on is that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the Concord that she's joining now is very different than the Concord that

Me: Right.

Them: thought she was coming into a year ago.

Me: When we first I just figured that when when we when we first had conversations a year ago, we were in a very different position. The world was very different.

Them: Yep. Exactly.

Me: And now we aren't in the you know, our policies have to are are adjusting, and we're you know, making sure that we're just storing up the organization.

Them: Yeah. Right.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Okay.

Me: Okay.

Them: Okay. You can put an ankle.

Me: Hi, Kathy. How are doing?

Them: So glad we can hear each other.

Me: Yeah. Yes. Exactly. Sorry.

Them: Yeah. That's great. I forgot about that.

Me: So Yes. To have missed you yesterday, but I'm glad you you made it back eventually from from everything. So it's good.

Them: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. So I wanted to make sure that we, you know, were all on the same page as I know you're going off on vacation and the like and I think we might have new different pictures about sort of what strategy and and expectations are going forward because I know you've been asking about some metals and thinking about other projects. I think that

Them: Yeah.

Me: I think the core thing to reinforce or sort of remind ourselves is the sort of expectations as we brought this transfer grant on more recently, which is you know, part of the reason that we, you know, said temporary employee status on that is that know, bringing this grant on, we've seen as as having a home for that grant to finish it out. An opportunity to make sure that that good work comes to its conclusion. But really as a sort of temporary employee and, you know, in the place that we are as an organization, we can't we have to be really strategic. We can't necessarily support you know, writing of new things or or written in on new things or, supplementals on that work. Just because we're in a really, you know, strategic place in general, very different than a year ago when we first started talking when the world was very different than it is now. Know, we're at a place where we're having to to shore up the the organization in general. And, you know, we let a lot of people go just recently We had a meeting yesterday where we were reminding people that we, you know, had plans to bring people down to a lower FTE across the board. We're getting some funding news that, you know, shifts things in some degree, but it doesn't change the overall picture that we're needing to be strategic as an organization even to the point of you know, I'm talking with folks internally who already had plans to submit, for example, supplementals and saying, alright. We need to be careful about what we whom we reach out to at what points, As an organization, it's the whole picture of people within NSF seeing you know, us popping up with supplementals in different places and weighing that And we've got a couple with Wu He already that we're balancing on. So all of those kinds of things, you know, even in general are places where we have to to be strategic. But, specifically, you know, as we were sort of said in the email when we brought this position on think we're just not unfortunately in a position to ex that work with supplementals or, you know, sort of write new grants. So I wanted to make that clear also recognize that, you know, we can be helpful, I think, in trying to figure out what the home for extension of that work might be. Maybe there are chances to talk about it at Brown or other kinds of things. But just we're really taking stock organizationally of where we'd stand trying to make sure that all the folks who are sort of in the core work are accounted for, and we're not even certain about that even as new funding news might come in.

Them: I guess, well, I guess, first, could you resend me that email? So

Me: So Yeah.

Them: it this obviously wasn't clear to me. And and I it really actually cripples my future. Because I am funded on soft grants. And if I am or soft money, and if I am continuing with you through June, then that's a long period of time at which I'm not getting future income for myself. And, and then also it's it's very hard to be part of a consortium

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: and yet not be part of the group. And so when I hear of things like you having a PI meeting, without me, when I feel like the people I'm working with actually aren't my collaborators. That I'm sort of a third class citizen, really. Or not even a citizen. You know? Off on my own little island, is a very hard space to work within, which I'm sure you can appreciate.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I I acknowledge I mean, this is an this is an odd and awkward situation.

Them: I

Me: Right now. I completely agree. And for lots of reasons in the political climate is yeah. And the funding climate is making it awkward, you know, for lots of other things in too, I would just say. I mean, it's nothing is is you know, sure footing or certain the way we're used to. And, you know, with this particular, you know, grant, I think, you know, we're in a place where, it's unusual, bringing this transfer on being uncertain about the places that were you know, how how it was coming across. Having to try to finish that out. I think I think the our main goal has been to to make sure that there's at least a home for that, that you've got a foot in because you're otherwise you'd be stranded without any way to make this stuff happen. And no employment for the coming months. So that doesn't seem right when this grant was, you know, so far along. But it you know, it's it's an odd situation to be in that. I I agree. And, also, also, not necessarily I mean, this is this is playing that grant out Let's see if we can find ways to help you know, figure out what the next steps are. Like I said, we've got experience and connections. Maybe we can apply those in in various ways to help move things forward. It's not that you can't you know, find ways to try to build on that work in other places. I just we're having to we're in really unusual position too. Of having to take stock of where things are. We're not used to saying, no to lots of things or to trying to tighten belts. But we're in in shifting waters right now. We need to to that out as an organization, and that makes it doubly awkward. So I appreciate that. Mhmm.

Them: Well, I mean, it's it's hard because, you know, I hear that there's a supplemental funding that's perfect for this grant. And there's also this $25,000 opportunity that's perfect for the data thon.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And to just let that go, is very difficult. And it's hard to really, for me to truly understand because when you work for any organization, it's a People put in their grants, and sometimes people are applying you know, putting in grants to the same programs. And and know, you have that chance to obtain the opportunity, but, ultimately, it's up to the reviewers or to the program agents to decide who's funded.

Me: Right. So for sub amount of funding in that particular case, it's actually and and for any of these, it's actually different in in organizations and, you know, we tend to be actually more lenient about this than many. You know, the there's an internal calculus that goes on to try to understand how to be exposed to a funding agency. So, you know, there are what did I hear? The American Museum of Natural History will allow one grant per competition to be submitted across the entire museum, for example. We submit 12 DRK12 grants, they submit one. Internally, they'll have a competition where they've got 40 people saying, wanna be the one they'll choose one. You know, we're certainly not when it comes to things like supplementals, for example, those are actually unique conversations with program officers individual program officers. So I'm internally telling people, no. Or wait or, you know, let's go with that one first now and then maybe, you know, four months from now, we can talk again. Because if we get overexposed, as an organization, we within NSF, for example, then it it has blowback, and we do the same kind of thing when we're thinking about submitting to program. Making sure we're not competing with ourselves overly. So that does happen internally. Just in general. And we're you know, continue that's even trickier right now because the NSF situation is so unclear.

Them: Well and I I thought of you as an more of an academic institution, not a not a museum type institution.

Me: Don't think that's the I don't think that's the situation. Academic institutions do the same thing. They still, you know, will internally apply for what they can put in and, you know, they have the same calculus to run with funders that I was describing there.

Them: I I think that's I I just can't picture a way forward for me within this environment. I just can't. I can't see how I can continue working in an environment where I'm not treated as an equal with, you know, Dan, for example. I mean, I know he's a senior scientist, and I'm a research scientist. But it's, it just doesn't feel right to me. And it it just it completely is the opposite of what I thought of you when I when I first chose Concord. Over

Me: It's it's it's really

Them: You know, you're not the people that I thought you were.

Me: well, it's really complicated, this situation is odd. I agree. And, you know, I think we're all learning as we go along. You know, I think that the I think the fit is complex, in general. And what I want to do in bringing this grant on is to to finish that grant out in a place where it had a home. It you know, I think you'd probably still be, you know, talking with them about this initial transfer. But it doesn't mean that there's not opportunity to think about things there, as well. I just you know, I think that that situation here is uniquely complex at the moment. And in general, you know, we wanted to hedge that as we came in, that we didn't set up expectations that it was anything more than that. And I know that that's different in the last months than it was when we first started talking because the world has changed so much. I mean, there was more there was more room to sort of play and flex and, you know, think broadly, you know, nine months ago. Than there has been in the last nine weeks or so. So that's also changed the the calculus. And that's just ground that's uncomfortable and unusual for all of us right now.

Them: Well, it is it me as well? I mean, is there something that's changed in our relationship that makes you feel that I'm not not on April footing or with other PIs? To support.

Me: I mean, I

Them: Or is there something that's changed in our relationship?

Me: I mean, I don't I think that we are just trying to understand how to keep the core organization together in general. Let's just say it that way. And you know, we're at a place where we're accounting for that. Even with the folks who have been on staff for a long time. Because you know, there are folks who are thinking about funding in different ways, and we need to count figure out that calculus. Etcetera. And so I'll admit that that the complication of bringing on new folks amid that is even harder because we know that that onboarding and acclimation takes you know, lots of effort. So I don't wanna bring you into a situation where we're dealing with that. And, you know, I think there is ground that we're we're learning and that, you know, we're learning together. Would take you know, a long time even in a funding situation that was more solid than we're in right now. So don't want to set up something that's not going to succeed. I would definitely say that. And I think that there are opportunities to try to work together to make sure that your you have paths to succeed in some way, shape, or form because you've established this work in NSF. NSF sees you as a PI, it doesn't matter to them necessarily that in one place or another, so maybe there are ways that we can find that set you up better in a in a place that builds on that work. Doesn't have the complication of having to put you in this uncertain climate internally here.

Them: Yeah. I mean guess my question is why do you think I would not succeed? It's I I think I need to

Me: Yeah. Go soon.

Them: go back to, you know, when we talked about you know, the transfer actually being finalized in August or whenever it was finalized. Right. Yeah. The, you know, at that at that time, we were we were wrestling with the fact that seven people we just had to lay off seven people. The the layoffs went through obviously, just a couple weeks ago, crazy enough. And, and everyone else is being reduced to 80% time, and we were starting to I think you're right. We had Concord has sort of thrived weirdly enough on the on an educational or, you know, research model where, like, people could put in DRK 12s if they had a good idea, and we would just sort of, you know, work with them as stuff got funded. But, more and more, as the administration frankly seems targeting higher ed and us too because we get the same grants as higher ed. Having to think a lot more like a small business than we've had to in the past. And that means being much more strategic, about what money we can go after, what ideas we put forward. And how many staff we think we can support during this time. We also got this bet this grant from Valhalla, allows us bring on a development person which is good. But it's clear that she's gonna need some time to get her feet under her and get going. And we just think in the past, we've been able to look into the crystal ball and guess what our future is gonna be. Now it's you know, the the discussions that we have had between us with the board have been really tough discussions. Think it's really it's really forced us to sort of think differently and and, count how many people we think we can support going forward. And so that so that's what makes this difficult. Like, we we did bring you on as a temporary employee because we knew that that was gonna be part of the calculation. We do have we have had employees in the past work at dual organizations. And, you know, so helping you, you know, maybe see you know, this grant out here, but in the meantime, also get you a position at Brown or some other places, and you start in grants there. So you've got a nice runway to build up your portfolio at a different place. Like, maybe we could help with that in some way. We can also know, try to transfer this grant again, maybe not now as we've gotten it organized, but, like, towards the end of it. So there's, you know, a pathway and some other organization for this grant. Not really sure what it would be, but just internally we're just having to think about things a little bit differently. And I have to say with this the you know, the way that they've recasted the DRK 12 RFP I mean Well, I mean, this this supplemental

Me: Yeah.

Them: would bring Concord $300,000\. It wouldn't have to include the subawardees, so that's why it's hard for me

Me: Like I said, you know, go

Them: to understand. You know, it's a lot of money,

Me: going for a supplement, so, Woogi, the program officer for this. And for at least two or more other things in the organization that, you know, we're looking at supplementals for We can't go and ask for three things from our program officer at once, and those are ones that we've already been you know, thinking about internally for a while. So so even even that specifically has calculus that, you know, goes along with it. I hope we're familiar with the supplemental game and it's a can be a delicate one even before it's publicly announced. And when it's publicly announced, it becomes both publicly competitive and, you know, remains delicate internally at the same time. So I'd I'd hear you on that, and it's that one is particularly strategic, let's just say.

Them: Right. I I really can't work in this environment. I'm sorry. I just, you know, if if I don't have colleagues, I don't have people that I can brainstorm with, which is what you know, I I thought I had. I've been collaborative in my promotion of Dan and CodeApp, and so many different ways and have continued to do so with Rista and the Tri State Alliance.

Me: And we're not trying to to diminish that.

Them: And to have that have that collaboration not returns you know, in any way, shape, or form. Is just to is just too much for me to be able to work with them. So I'll have to you know, I know I'm going on vacation. I'll have to think about this. Currently, the group I'm with at Brown is wonderful for supporting the the Datathon. But not for the educational aspects and research that I'm interested in. And I know I don't have the qualitative research background, However, I'm a very quick learner and have the quantitative data background. And, you know, the soft sciences are something that unfortunately, historically, have been sort of frowned upon as as, you know, not true science. But it's not something that would be difficult for me to understand in any way. So, I guess one possibility maybe would be to shelve this grant you know, until I can find someone that that can work with me and and my goals. Because it's it's just not a a good work environment You know? I mean, if you put yourself in my position, and especially with the stress that I've had over the last year. Is just not the warm, nurturing environment that thought it should be. Sorry. I'm getting very emotional, so I should probably go now. So

Me: No. I I under I understand. Well, I understand and I recognize the the complexities out know I can't appreciate your, you know, personal sort of roller coaster there. You know, I I would just say we've been wrestling as this grant has gone through its tummules. With those complexities as well of, like, saying, oh, what you know, are we putting you in a problematic position by taking it on? Putting you in a worse position by saying no at the point when it's abandoned by EBAC. And, you know, that that already is a a really complicated thing to weigh. I think, you know, in my view, trying to at least provide a home for this grant so that you had a place to be able to think from is better than than not. But I you know, which I didn't I didn't wanna orphan it out there deliberately. But I appreciate the the, you know, awkward and complexity of this. And I think, you know, if there's a way that we can help find the right solution that works for you, I think that great. And I'm really, you know, sorry that the world is so bizarre right now. We have to you know, arrange things in ways that are awkward. I don't like that.

Them: Yeah.

Me: But I also don't wanna strain you when we could be a resource. So I appreciate that. Complexity.
