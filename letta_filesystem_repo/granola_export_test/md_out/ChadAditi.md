Transcript:

Me: Hello, ma'am.

Them: Hi, Chad. How are you doing?

Me: Doing well. How are you?

Them: I'm doing alright. You're in a different spot today.

Me: I'm yes. I'm in the car place trying to get figure out our automatic car sensors that have been on the fritz for, like, three months. So, finally got somebody who was willing to tell me it wasn't the windshield glass that needed changing. It's like I'm like, no. It's not the windshield glass. It's something like they bumped the sensor. Anyway, so if I get called away, that's what it is. Anyway, hello and welcome and oh my gosh, I have not talked to you since you were official, I guess,

Them: Yeah. It's been so exciting.

Me: officially official four days ago. Right.

Them: It's been so exciting and weird to, like, meet with Lisa and you who I have worked very closely now for a whole year. Like, I'm actually at Concord now. It's, like, it's it's

Me: Exactly. Yeah.

Them: been a good yeah.

Me: Awesome. Well, I'm I'm thrilled and and glad to to connect and sort of catch up on where you're and everything else is. And, like you've got a lot of things in the air, in many different ways. So

Them: Yeah.

Me: that's all good, and and I'm sure crazy making as well.

Them: Wait. I don't know. We got you you you saw the reject email. Right? The the d r k 12 that didn't come through the teacher learning

Me: That was the MSA one. The Lewiston one.

Them: That was the one that we ended up so it started with MMSA. Submitted to an it was the one where we we've talked about it, Chad.

Me: Yeah. But it ended up in Lewiston regardless. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have.

Them: Reviews were all this is great. And then they were like, we can't submit it. We can't

Me: Right. Yeah, yeah. Right. Mhmm.

Them: yeah. So that was the most promising that was the one that I had most of my hopes on. The others are all, like,

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: I doubt they're coming through. That that's I I wish I wish this this wasn't the thing I was saying, but

Me: Yeah. Yeah. No. Sure. I mean, this this is this is all, like,

Them: it you know, maybe Yeah.

Me: that's been pending for months and months, right? Mhmm. Yeah. I mean, if we haven't heard by now, then then it's definitely

Them: Exactly.

Me: know, either it's surprising that the nose haven't gotten there, it's, you know, been on left on somebody's dusty desk who's gone or something like that. Who knows? Right?

Them: Exactly.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But Lisa shared that that we got to I mean, by we, I mean, Concord.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Got to, DRK Quest, which is very exciting.

Me: Yes.

Them: Or are recommended at this point.

Me: Well, yes. Recommended is the it's very exciting and now we just watch the calendar and hope that recommended means real and, you know, somebody's trying to run out the clock or something, at the same time. So

Them: Yeah. Right.

Me: everything needs to be done by September 30\. So Mhmm. But yes, there are definitely a number of things that are

Them: Yeah.

Me: through questions and recommended and sitting there pending, which should

Them: Yeah. And

Me: be marvelous.

Them: I mean, I think NSF would want to get it out before September 30\. Like, I'm sure they I hope

Me: I think so, yes. Exactly. I'm hoping that the person who has to be the final review, also shares that, that and is not trying to drag feet or what have you or who knows what

Them: Exactly.

Me: But, I mean, they certainly got the termination letters all out in one day, or the the the appeal response is all out in in, like, six hours time. So want to do something, they can certainly do it somehow.

Them: Yeah. And it since they put AI, I feel like, you know, chances are they will they will come through.

Me: Yeah. No. I'm I'm hopeful.

Them: But, yeah, I wanna hear more about Lisa mentioned a few times that there are these PI meetings that you'll probably have to attend. Where they start thinking about proposal.

Me: Yeah. So I mean, there's a bunch of different stuff, and we're trying to

Them: Right.

Me: rethink and regroup on, a number of fronts as well. Just to figure out what meetings should be happening regularly.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And we're at the point of needing to ideate and about proposals, etcetera, and we're all you know, sort of looking at the schedules and wondering and whatever. But I think I think my take was just talking about this with Dan yesterday. And I think my take is that the things that are posted are still there, and they're not taking them down. And they can take them down if they want to. It So so if they're up then they're valid enough to write toward, even if something changes last minute,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: those ideas are still solid. Even if we're syncing things into things, you know, 15 page whatever's that maybe aren't going anywhere, well, it's proposal pressure for one. It's resubmittable something for two. It's three five page proposals to foundations for three. I mean, I there's real value, you know, perhaps most of all for me, it's that the energy put into trying to figure out a new the new idea or the new take or the new something

Them: Mhmm.

Me: that's an exercise I think we need to do yesterday in lots of ways anyway.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So I think there's I think there's a lot of value to trying to, you know, just presume that DRK12 is there and use it as an exercise, at the very least, and hopefully even more

Them: Mhmm.

Me: and to go from there. And the same for I mean, there are only a couple that are up officially, although the you may be a little more in the CS world. I mean, the they don't really know what to do with the new core future computing education one that

Them: Mhmm.

Me: came out with, like, one month notice on September 16\. It's a that's the program announcement from size you might have seen.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Size, yeah, it was like Size does everything in one big program announcement of it.

Them: It's too short notice to do something.

Me: It's, yeah, too short in general unless you have something ready anyway. And I think it's their sort of run it just trying to get that announcement out there and

Them: Mhmm.

Me: some way, shape, form. But other than that, it seems like haven't gone through and parsed really closely, but it seems like the, you know, ECR core and DRK12 are the closest

Them: Right.

Me: on the schedule to be looking at. And are things to be talking about right away. Whether it's those or just ideas matters less to me than the ideas, you know, the sort of ideation phase of things, because I think that's where are new nuts to be cracked, that we haven't quite all figured out to some degree or another.

Them: Yeah. So two questions come to mind as you you were sharing. One is I was looking at the newsletter and sort of your your portion of the newsletter. And my takeaway from what I remember my takeaway was from what I read was that the cuts aren't as big as we thought they would be. Is that is that where what you're still seeing?

Me: I think that so yes. Well, definitely the administration's budget is not

Them: Mhmm.

Me: be the budget. There's no question about that. Where we stand right now is the the house ran away screaming or ducking for cover. After they had done the first part of their appropriation process and then they heard the word up's done in Bran. The Senate stayed put. And said that's our job, stay put and be sensible here. And finished out their I think, pretty much their whole appropriations process. They had, like, a funding bill

Them: Okay.

Me: within that, the Senate you know, signs commerce justice, whatever, CJR committee, said we like NSF and NASA are important. And they initially cut NSF by 0\.6%. I think there was some other weirdness that made it go up by point five or one some percent. Education side of it, when it cut down to line items, was cut by 14%. That's not 56%. You know? So that was there was some

Them: Mhmm.

Me: some cut to education, but not significant. And I think, I'm not sure about this, but I think the Senate sort of wrapped up their funding piece. The House still in the middle like with papers left on the desk because everybody fled town. They did their first pass at appropriations for the science committee but didn't get to the

Them: Mhmm.

Me: the detail of the appropriations as far as I know. And they're coming back September 2, you know, everybody.

Them: Okay.

Me: And so the situation there is you've got between September 2 and September 30 to get all of the appropriations lined up entirely or the government shuts down. And so the then you're normally you're in the case where congress can't do anything. And, you know, the new normal is that they a continuing resolution. So we don't have a 2025 budget. We're working on the 2024 budget because they never got around to a '20 agreeing on a 2025 budget last time around.

Them: Okay.

Me: So I think I think there's, a $50\.50 coin flip. That we might be in the same situation going forward. And they just can't get it together, still. And we end up with the 2024 lines still running forward, which would mean ASF was level funded from before this

Them: Mhmm.

Me: administration. If we're not in that place, it seems like the most probable thing is we're not in that place because the senate is playing the game of staying late on a Saturday, which they never ever ever do.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: To get all their bills in place. To go to the house and go, so you wanna get this funded? Just agree with this. You know, here's the whole package. You can just say that's all good. Photocopy it and make it the house version, and then we'll all chug it through. I think the ability for the house to go, no, we hate that. And we're gonna be you know, efficient enough to get all of our packages in place and then negotiate them to something that makes bigger cuts. I mean, that in twenty eight days, which is, like, ten minutes in in congress time,

Them: Yeah.

Me: probably not gonna so so I think we're likely to see, you know, maybe there's some back and forth, and more than 14%, but it's not 56%. And, you know, it could be zero and it's somewhere in between.

Them: Uh\-huh. Mhmm.

Me: So you know, so it's not as insane as one might think. NSF still is gonna exist There will be money for education.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: What I think we don't know is what NSF looks like inside and the ability for them to work while trying to find a place to stash their tent when they can't be in their building and, you know, all that crazy So I think it's gonna be I mean, I don't know that the programs that exist right now are gonna continue to exist, Obviously, the ones that say the I can't obviously, the solicitations that are there are still there when you submit something to them. Obviously, you're submitting it under the new rules. Not quite clear how they reconcile the solicitation that exists with the DEI list world. It's possible that they say just kidding in, like, two weeks before those solicitation deadlines they pull them all down and say, we've gotta rewrite them. I I don't know about that. I don't know how to deal with the

Them: Mhmm. Right.

Me: it's all gonna be about AI and quantum, you know, world. If NSF is fully funded, So I think there's some in between there. I think it's gonna be more administration priorities than not. I don't think, you know, the old programs are gonna continue to exist.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: What it means to submit to DRK 12 right now and that proposal goes, don't really know.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: There's not gonna not be money. And I think on the strategy side, there will be there are certainly people, you know, unfortunately, who have aligned themselves, their lines of work with you know, so intently with the EEI that it's just not worth the effort to apply to federal or to to rework that. I don't think that's you know, in 90% of the world, but it's not 0%.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I think that there's a chunk of folks, and you may have a better feeling than this, you know, wandering in university ish circles, but that people who are, like, screw that. Like, I'm not even gonna bother

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I think there are universities who are like, you're not even gonna bother even if you want to.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So I think the competition will be down to some degree. Not entirely, but I think my gut would say down at least the same degree as the funding. So it kind of feels like normal ish competition in a weird world. I don't know. I mean, it's

Them: Yeah. I don't I don't

Me: the 7% competition is not going to be the

Them: yeah. I don't know about whether university researchers are backing down. And I I don't have a but my sense is I don't know about backing down, but I definitely see everyone, including myself,

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: being like, okay. Let's do AI now. And that was very visible. Like, at ISLS. I didn't actually make it to the conference, but just going through the proceedings, Last year, there was maybe 5% of, you know, papers that were AI and within a year. Like, huge shift. And I haven't seen that. Even when the whole, like, computational thinking became a thing, it it was also, like, sudden, but it took two, three years. It wasn't within a year.

Me: Right.

Them: And so

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so I don't know I I don't know if we can expect if it's going to be proportionate in that way. You know? The the

Me: Yeah. No. Right. I I don't know. I mean, I

Them: in the comp of course, they need funding less than we do. Right?

Me: right.

Them: They have salaries, and and we

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. I mean, I I think it's you know, I don't have a sense

Them: So

Me: of the the size of the effect, but I think that the I think the combination of hassle

Them: Mhmm.

Me: and university hesitancy is gonna account for something I mean, it's like

Them: Mhmm.

Me: hassle, uncertainty, and hesitancy, even if you're not hassled the, like, do I write for a program that doesn't exist right now or not? And SF is calling for proposal pressure, but I don't have time

Them: Right.

Me: by the way, I've got classic classes starting or whatever. I mean, that's gonna be something

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: I think the, like, is it even worth my effort or not is in general, is another And I I think that there's some layer of, like, I just got

Them: Mhmm.

Me: had one tough conversation with my dean, I don't want to have another one or something. There may be

Them: Yeah.

Me: Again, I think people still need money, people still want to do their research, they're still going to submit in some way, shape or form, but but they're not going to actively be excited about it the same way that we might have been three years ago. There's something in there.

Them: Right. Right.

Me: Anyway, it all just says, I think I don't think running from proposals is the way to go. I think

Them: Mhmm.

Me: it's a crapshoot more than usual in lots of ways. I think submitting more rather than less is probably fine and competing with oneself is a little bit less of a concern than it might normally be.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: And we're all I think everybody is kind of on pause, so to some degree there is a of resubmission to be had that we might normally be like, oh well, maybe that wasn't so Actually, maybe let's resubmit those too, then think about two new ones or something, you know, is a little more of the order of the day.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Anyway, that's you're thinking the same thing I am, I think.

Them: Yeah. And then I think the other

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: that came up because Amanda DK is an IG MRI. And we have a CS for all.

Me: Yep.

Them: That is in that we've not heard anything about, and that was a good proposal that and it's a solid RPP. I'm wondering if anyone at Concord has heard have you heard back on CS for all yet at all?

Me: So yes, we have one that is in negotiationrecommended, was quite a surprise.

Them: And it's EA? Or it's not AI?

Me: I see, yes, it's AI and machine learning. But I came back relatively recently, think, after the curve level had started, which made it more of a surprise. But more than that, I don't know.

Them: Okay.

Me: Like I said, I don't think people are in the mode of trying to start new sets of questions and negotiations right now. Think most of the recommended stuff is recommended. In programs that are for which the awards are closing before this fiscal year. I mean, they're programs that the six month period is lopping over the fiscal year, and I know what that does.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: But, yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't expect new stuff, especially given that they sounds like I didn't verify but they closed the CS for All RFP

Them: It did.

Me: online, I think,

Them: My god. I think

Me: I think I that's what I just heard the other day. I haven't gone to check it.

Them: find it.

Me: It. But it surprised me that they didn't do it two months ago. And especially if core futures from size came out with this computing education strand. Probably that's the let's kick it there.

Them: Wow.

Me: Which doesn't mean yeah.

Them: Right. They did. I didn't

Me: It doesn't it doesn't doesn't mean that they're not making awards under the program that was

Them: right.

Me: but they're definitely not taking the I mean, I don't know how they could defend that one in general. I mean, yes, computing. But it's just so intertwined with, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: equity and it was already complicated to triangulate that one.

Them: Yeah. Okay. This is the

Me: I know exactly.

Them: it is where we are.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So we heard back on the Spencer a couple of days ago. You remember that was, the, you know, share a five page We that one didn't get through.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Amanda and I are thinking about what, you know, why and what does it mean and all of that. I am I'm just feeling like modeling is out. Like, I don't think that anyone's, like, anyone's interested in it right now. Which makes me wonder if the DRK 12 with the strong reviews, we should even resubmit or just

Me: We should look at it and think about what the benefits of it might be and

Them: you know,

Me: I think anything that we have strong reviews on, should should consider the strong elements of it and also within this world that we're living in as opposed to the world we're in, know, twelve months ago. So, so yes and,

Them: Yeah. Yeah. I I've spoken with the other PIs on that project, and he is interested in resubmitting. He just got an assistant professorship.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Needs funding, interested in resubmitting. I told him I'd get back to him.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because I do want to be like, I think you're right. It's okay to with yourself and submit multiple. But then

Me: But they shouldn't be well, they shouldn't be crappy, so yeah.

Them: yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So things to think about. But there was something else coming up for me. Yeah. So then the d r k 12 well, actually, there are a couple of other so one update is that I am expecting

Me: Yes, I

Them: and

Me: congratulations. That's exciting. What is that

Them: yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So I am

Me: What's the timing on all that?

Them: yeah. So I'm in month four currently.

Me: Okay. Sure.

Them: I so it's, you know, I would I'm just starting to share with people.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: We are due in end of Jan.

Me: Okay.

Them: Early Feb.

Me: Okay.

Them: And so when I talked with Sue and Lisa oh, no. When I talked with Judy, she was like, you know, just let Chad know so it's on his radar that you're going to be

Me: Yep.

Them: away or whatever. And the benefits Because I don't I'm not on benefits. So what that looks like, I'll figure out.

Me: Yep.

Them: With her, but I just I want you to be aware of it.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: And so that will impact

Me: Alright.

Them: what the arcade like, the timing of the r k 12 there. Right? Right? Because I'm not

Me: Sure.

Them: I'm not coming back in Feb or March.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: You know? So

Me: But I mean, you can you can put a start date in. That's different. You can put a start date in that's a year later anyway. You can write a proposal with different start

Them: Right. Right. Yeah. So that's just something that I want you to be aware of.

Me: Yep. Totally. Yeah.

Them: And then the other pieces that the other I'm just I'm like, there these items are not connected to one another. But the other thing is we so in the Moda team, the I test project, you know, Michelle and I have been talking to the to the TC group and talking about player. And it it's looking like the it it took a lot of arguing for why moving to activity player is a good move. But to Michelle and Meets, it it was really obvious. Like, it felt like a no brainer just given all the advantages it comes with. You know, of course, it's it's a big move for someone who's like, this is new to me. So it's taken some convincing. And one of the things that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: but I think they're I think, like, that we are over that hurdle, and we're now onboard about activity player. But one of the questions that keeps coming up, that I want to talk through with you about both in terms of how does Concord usually deal with this, but also just in terms of what do you think about it. Is, you know, a concern that someone at Concord will write a grant about Moda, without including anyone on the original team. And Michelle was like, that that's not going to happen. Like, story builder, every time something gets

Me: Mhmm.

Them: written, I get asked. You know? So she she was she has a history of working with you guys. She was like, that's not going to happen. That's not the institution that Concord is. But I'm curious about how for Codep, which I mean, I know Kodak comes from Tinkerplot, so it has a longer sort of Right? It didn't begin didn't Codeb. But what was that transition like when it moved from people who built the tool wrote proposals about it to now, like, you know, others are writing without including people at Concord.

Me: Interesting question. I don't know if they're fully comparable, so we can talk about them both and then think about the principal notion and about the moda application of it. To answer the question, it was pretty straightforward. Although that might have been its singular reason, is that Bill and Kodap came across at the same time at the beginning of their creation period at a moment when CODAP was sort of extricating itself from its current existence, and Bill had all the toys anyway, which is to say Tinkerplot's well, so for the quick history lesson, fathom has been the thing from the very beginning curriculum press developed Fathom became software and was sort of shrink wrapped software over twenty years or so. TinkerPlots actually uses Fathom as its core engine, and was developed

Them: Okay.

Me: by Cliff and separately but in close conjunction with Key Curriculum Press and Bill and what have you.

Them: Okay.

Me: Then McGraw Hill bought Key Curriculum Press and had Fathom and other things along with it. Didn't understand what Fathom was. It was this weird animal walking around in the corner, and Bill tried to explain to them for a year what it was, and they didn't get it. In the meantime, he wrote the CODAP grant and got it. And then you know, called us. We were like, yeah. We've been talking about Tinker, Button, Fathom for years. Like, it'd be awesome to work together. And he's like, well, how about we just move it over? And so Bill moved the Kodap grant over to Concord and came on to Concord all at the same time. And that cliff was sort of you know, starting to retire anyway. And, like, all well and good, he was in some of the initial advisory board meetings for the CODAP work, etcetera. Etcetera. But he was also happy to just sit at home. We sold shrink\-wrap fathom on our side for a number of years just to keep the people going who were already using it. Cliff redid Tinkerplots and might even still be selling it. Don't know what sold it for a while separately also, but we were transitioning

Them: Mhmm.

Me: to CodeApp all the way along the way. By the way, the before the CODAP grant came an inquiry space grant which had Bill as a codap and Uri as a logo.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And essentially, that's where

Them: Mhmm. I was a grad student then, so I would hear all about that project.

Me: right. So that's what paid for net logo to start and that going to 5 in the first place, so that was another layer. But, you know, long story, truly short, So then Bill was here. Put up with being developed, Bill was involved in that development, but then people would write lots of different kinds of things. Bill was often involved in them as an advisor or as a small amount of time or whatever. For development or, like, Michelle's work would bring Bill in to help develop the plug ins

Them: Mhmm.

Me: what have you. But it was always intended as a as an open thing to be used by lots of people in different ways. It was always as more of a fully featured standalone existing product than almost anything else it conquered in its own right. It sort of had a different a slightly different life in the trajectory of those kinds of things than we have

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So on that now, like, you well, you can write a grant with CodeUp and not tell Bill and be from another place or whatever. We'll write grants, he'll occasionally know what's going on, but not always with it. If we're changing core code APIs, obviously been involved, but you can just use it. It's

Them: Mhmm.

Me: so it's not necessarily the same thing. The distinction there is that that's sort of like a product that you can like Microsoft Word, like nobody's going to say you can't use that

Them: Right.

Me: in something. Moda isn't isn't that, and I'm not pertaining to understand the nuances, but it's a little bit more of a philosophy principle, you know, combination of software packages

Them: Mhmm.

Me: than it is a whole thing. And so, like, the ability to, like, take and run with MODA per se I think,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: would be very different than taking and running with something else.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: And it only lives as much as the sort of lines of work and the philosophy and the understanding is behind. I mean, it'd be hard somebody else to make a case for using moda because it's kind of a a combination of theory and software together.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: On the principal side of things, people don't generally generally, things are much more in that camp than not. Jay does really great stuff with Stora Q, which is a curriculum, and it's also thinking about machine learning and it's embedded in CodeApp, it's embedded in Crew and something, but I wouldn't like, say, oh, somebody else go dudes story queue for whatever without connecting with Jay. You know, both because you wouldn't do that and because it would be kinda silly because you wouldn't gain any benefit from having that part, you know, that connection in there.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: There are there are cases where the whom do you need to pull in and talk to becomes vaguer. So, like, if you've got four partners on that, we didn't call it Roo when we did the next round of inquiry space because he was busy doing other stuff with it, and he wasn't offended by it at all. And it was fine because the caller network

Them: Right.

Me: was there. So when there are other partners into something, like, think there's an open question Like how often do we call Tamar and Paolo when we're using one of the three elements of Moda that we developed in some new something. I don't know about those.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: We ever we could call something moda without having you

Them: Right.

Me: probably driving driving it? No. Because we don't even know how to spell it, much less

Them: Right.

Me: make the argument, and it would be kinda silly. So, you know, so and, you know, there are cases that are different than other cases. We'll be like, oh, should do the SageModeler thing, we should use that curriculum. And Dan's like, yeah, great. Let me talk check with Joe. Some relationships are different than others.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: So we get it We're not going to run away. At the same time, there might be cases where, oh, that's a good one for just tomorrow because it's seven hundred k, and this one needs Michelle because it's thinking about this layer and, you know, oh,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Paolo called us up and asked about being an advisor for

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Spencer Vision thing just recently. Like, yeah. Yeah. Right right at the end as an adviser on the

Them: Yeah. We need to talk about that. I haven't

Me: something. And even then, I was like, oh, yeah. That wasn't my radar screen crap. You definitely read us in. And I spent about twenty four hours going like, well, should I say actually no and scrambled? Because we probably should have actually been writing one anyway. But we weren't together with I didn't have it together on that.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So there's a little bit of back and forth,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: but there's not you don't have to worry about somebody, like, running away with partners or offending people or running away with soft

Them: And and that's not what that's not my question, actually, because I

Me: software or what have you. Yeah.

Them: I I won't I I'm much more

Me: Yeah.

Them: with my ideas. Like, I don't I don't if someone does, you know, there are lots of ideas in the world, lots of good ones. To go So I I'm less concerned about that, and I know you have a history of Like, I've heard of you guys since Uri. Right? Like so I've heard

Me: Yeah.

Them: Concord very positively for, like, twenty years at this point. I my question was more about what you were starting to get at. Which is if I wanted to write a grant, like, I'm sort of curious about how and maybe Codep isn't the best example, but how developments if if I wanted to write a grant, do I have to involve write because it starts getting really clunky. Right? Like, if you have three other partners and the project needs

Me: Yeah.

Them: another expert partner, then, like, there are five partners and that

Me: Yeah. You should you should do what you think

Them: the same.

Me: is right. I think that's one of the questions. You should that's and that's like the Dan Joe thing. Like, I mean, when he'll say I'll check with Joe, like, he'll do it as a courtesy, and there are other times when, like, he won't run with, like, the assessor assessment stuff that they did together with Wes said. Like that, you really can't move forward because that group feels pretty strongly about it. It's something other cases, Dan just like don't want Joe to hear about that in the, you know, the back end after we, you know, ran forward with it for seven months or something

Them: Mhmm.

Me: that. But Joe doesn't have time to be involved and doesn't wanna be involved. He just wants to know. So, you know, there's different layers for different something. But I don't pretend to know all the nuances of it. But I I don't see Moda in the same sentence that a sentence that doesn't have a d d in it in some way. But I'd do imagine that there are sentences that don't have seven different partners in it.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: That's your that's your call to make as far as I'm concerned, both because you know the relationships and you know that he's got the technology. And by the way, like you're saying,

Them: Right.

Me: maybe it's not Moda. Maybe it's Oda or it's something or it's Da. I'd like Those are all things that get figured out, too. Just because I mean, just because you had a great dinner party doesn't mean that you have to invite everybody at the dinner party and five other sets of people

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm. Right. Right.

Me: like, some people are better for one project than another, and everybody gets that. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I yeah. That's just that's helpful to hear and especially with SageModeler, which it does feel like a closer, because I yeah. How long do we have this meeting for? There is one other thing I'm gonna ask.

Me: I'm I'm totally fine. Yep. I'm I'm open.

Them: Okay.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The other thing that so, Leah, who's the driver behind the Spencer vision,

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: proposal, she reached out to me and she was, hey. Can you be an adviser through Concord?

Me: Mhmm. Oh, yeah.

Them: And then I was like, what has happened so far? Because I don't want to, you know, like,

Me: I mean,

Them: step on any toes.

Me: basically yeah. What what's happened so far is Pablo said, hey. Do you want it? And I was like, yeah. Probably. Let get back to you. And he's like, hey. Haven't you gotten back to me? I'm like, oh, yeah. Good point. You know, all good. Do whatever you want. And that's all I said. So I saw their one pager It looked innocuous. I don't know if it's strong or weak or whatever.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: But not the proposal yet. And I said, yeah. Happy to play There's no money, so, obviously, probably you're gonna write us in as a name.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And I haven't said it any more. I haven't had a meeting with them I haven't made laid any claim to anything or not. Mhmm.

Them: But is there right, is there an assigned person at Concord already? Because then if they're

Me: No.

Them: I don't want to overstep.

Me: Nope. Mm\-mm. There's no assigned person to Concord. I mean,

Them: Okay.

Me: I think so and and I think probably it should be you both because of the relationship with Apollo because it would be a good chance to think about something if it were more than 75 k in five minutes of time, we might think about a both end because it seems like code app is what they're interested in. But regardless, like, good. Like, that's a good chance for you to figure out how to front Kodap from Concord and something at the same time. So

Them: Mhmm.

Me: think I think it'd be great if you were that because otherwise it's gonna fall to me because I got the email and I gonna mess it up because I don't have time. Like, so that'd be great.

Them: Yeah. So let me talk to Leah again.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And see just where she's at.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And and figure things out. But I want you to know this is happening in the back end.

Me: That's totally fine. Yep.

Them: That she she texted being like, hey.

Me: Yep. Yep. And

Them: Yeah. It was a

Me: right. And you should

Them: uh\-huh.

Me: it would be if there's anything substantive that gets involved in the I don't know, in the writing or the thinking of the something. I mean, a planning grant, it's not

Them: Mhmm.

Me: huge. But but there would be value in like I don't think they're gonna in a planning grant, they're not gonna make promises about what to do with software, so I wouldn't be I don't I don't think you need to spend too much energy thinking about that. But in terms of the substantive crafting of a good argument about place based data education, may be well worth a conversation with Kate for, you know, forty five minutes just to pick her brain about it because there may very I don't my guess is probably a you know, we're people have done lots of things, but there may be, you know, references I ideas, things, whatever that they haven't been thinking of that would be worth your bringing in vicarious

Them: Yeah. That makes sense. I

Me: So Mhmm.

Them: did Leah that Kate Miller is a good person to connect with just because of the work that she has done.

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: Yeah. So that makes sense. Okay. So those are all the things that I needed to talk about outside of, like, now I'm at Concord.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: What do I need to do? Other things that I'm not aware of that I need to do or

Me: Yeah, so not a whole lot, on the

Them: yeah.

Me: like technical requirements and whatever side of things. We as Judy was alluding to, we have traditionally had monthly meetings of sort of a coordinating group in the past. We're trying to re figure what the meetings are that we need to have with a slightly smaller group starting in you know, September. And to think about those in the context of how we're orienting to the world. There's sort of a couple new bubbles of thinking that we haven't focused on as much. Haven't consciously focused on professional development, in part because I know it's not a moneymaker as much as the time suck, but it's it's a thing, and there are several groups that are sort of interested in it. So we've got a small couple of people who's gonna be kind of managing how we think about offering professional development and what that means to offer it for money

Them: Mhmm.

Me: There is a relatively small group, which is mostly Leslie and myself, thinking about, about publisher and other kinds of business relationship business sort of deals that we've done trying to figure out how to to do that in a fuller way. We have a new

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Director of Development coming in September 2 as well, and so we will have more capacity to think about private funding than we've had in the past.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Infinitely more because we haven't really had capacity for it. So thinking about foundation leads and possibilities, thinking about even individual donors or donor advised funds. Like, if there's money in non federal places, we have capacity to think about that, that we end some experience that we haven't before. So that's a layer of conversation that reporting in new And just to round out the circle, I'm trying to make a push amid proposals and stuff, is more important. To get us to understand better user discovery? Like, how do you How do you understand what users needs really are

Them: Where the users are teachers?

Me: in a way that can help drive Yes. Educators, I think, well, yes. And I think our two our two sort of big groups are educators because they are the decision makers about what goes in front of students,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: and district people, whatever that means, they are connected to the layers that that might involve integration, like LTI integration of things into the service or integration of services into software and schools or what have you.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: We probably should consider publishers and folks like that as well.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Harder to do a whole bunch of user interviews with publishers without burning bridges or confusing

Them: Mhmm.

Me: people. So, you know, educators are at the starting point. But we're looking at local conferences, trying to think about this and trying to, and their sort of three ways of doing this. One is have for lack of a better term, focus groups, but really it's not about here's a product, don't you like it? It's more like tell me about your life and I'm gonna listen for the things you're not saying.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: But, like, what are you really struggling with? What are you really trying to to get done as a teacher, and what are the barriers?

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Groups of seven to 15 people like that There's there's just individual interviews when people do this with products. They'll have a product. They'll be think they know what the value proposition and they'll call, like, say, they'll have, like, 75 interviews with individual users. And after that, harrowing experience, you really get a sense of where people are with their

Them: Mhmm.

Me: need. And the thing that you thought you were solving, like, they don't care about at all, but the thing that you was, like, were just gonna throw away as a throwaway feature, they're, Oh, that's actually solving the real problem. And then there are more organized design sprints, which is a sort of formalized five day process that Google popularized a number of years ago. Where you sort of start at the beginning with an idea, a glint of an idea and sort of work it through its paces in really structured way and then create a throwaway prototype. Literally on the fly, And then on Friday, you put it in front of, like, eight users in line and get us as you take in something from

Them: Mhmm.

Me: total random idea to actual testable concept within five days.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: All different variations on a theme of listening to actual users. Which is either completely the way you should do things in general if you're a normal you know, company or completely foreign if you're somebody like us or researchers or whatever,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: for whom the actual customer that you don't realize is the NSF review panel and teachers kinda don't like if people use their stuff or don't, it kind of doesn't matter because all that matters is getting the next grant,

Them: Right.

Me: from the review panels. So my my notion is, like, if we actually bring in real users and try to connect them into this, then all it does is make these things stronger to NSF, and we can leverage this huge engine of innovation money that startups can't at all

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And like, Worst case scenario, it's okay and they like it, but liked it a little bit like they always did. Best case scenario actually maybe we find something they value so much that they pay for some portion of it and we get

Them: Mhmm.

Me: some sustainability, perished the thought. All of it is stronger than it would be in the first place because it's not

Them: Right.

Me: harebrained idea that we all thought about in a room and then told teachers that they wanted.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Anyway, there's some

Them: Yeah.

Me: some push to try to bring users in in ways that we haven't before. Mhmm. I'm sure there is.

Them: I I wonder if there's a fourth path there, Chad, that is because I feel like all of the three you're talking about are, like, sort of Concord doing everything from scratch.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But I wonder about whether we can, like, connect with publishers, curriculum that exists and is, like, open site.

Me: Oh, yeah.

Them: Is doing computer science. Like, just yesterday, Brian, right, Brian emailed saying, hey. Can you be a discussant at Nars for our session? Right? Like, we can and I don't think they're doing code app

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: kind of stuff yet. Like, can we and they have foundations money. Right? Like, they've already those relationships figured out, and I think they had a couple of brands from from the Grand Foundation, which I was talking about with you last time we met. Can we connect with them and say, hey. You know, like, are you interested in bringing a stool into your curriculum? I have strong relationships with lots of people at Open Sided. And, like, dry part, like, sort of piggyback on their success. Right? Or, you know, illustrative math. This was an idea that, Bill Penuel gave us on our RPP with GMRI. We have a strong relationship with this district. That uses illustrative math. And the work Amanda and I have been doing is infused into illustrative math. We go to illustrative math and say, your unit six is all about you know, distributions and data and all of that. We have this amazing thing Let's talk. And I'm I'm wondering if and those are two examples that come off the top of my head, but there are probably others I'm not even thinking of.

Me: Yes, yes and is the answer. Definitely those layers are you know, are things that we should be doing also and in conjunction, I guess, is my is my answer. You know, we're having conversations with publishers and those are changing as well in that many times before we would do the thing that you're describing,

Them: Okay.

Me: ten years ago, we'd the thing you're describing and they'd be like, what is I don't understand that. I don't understand who you are. Don't understand this thing. I don't understand this whatever. If they did understand it, that's all well and good, but they didn't know how to work with us. Because we're this weird nonprofit, so we've learned

Them: Okay.

Me: to become at that time, day and age, like a vendor, and we've done sort of work for hire it would be like ICR developing curriculum that might involve simulations. We have a whole lot of simulations, and we know how to build them.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Can we be or instead of going to, you know, wherever, can we be your, you know, builder for those things and sort of partner in doing that?

Them: Mhmm.

Me: That's been been a fruitful and replicable, to some degree, fruitful and replicable pattern you know, with the downside that doesn't, you know, have ongoing licensing revenue or what have you, but it does can be 6 figures in a, you know, a one, two, three year stint. And the impact is part of what we're aiming for, We're taking this work and moving people's ideas forward in ways that they're making them reach higher to the breast ring than they would have with the outsourced whatever.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: That's a model that we can continue to play out. Often the like we've got a really cool thing doesn't that automatically fit within the thing that you're doing? Has been a little bit of a nonstarter because they don't quite get it or it's more complicated than that or what have you. That said, things are kind of flipping now in that you know, in ways that are making us think differently too, and that like, for example, Pearson with the math curriculum recently came to us and said, So we're using CodeApp in this full math curriculum that we're introducing to California, And we're like, great, on the one hand. They're embedding it into these three day inquiry units in algebra. Like, woah, that's great, and that's the kind of thing that you should be doing. Other hand, like, so yes, we know it's free and open source, but if you're a publisher, publisher really, that's not the way publishers do business. Probably a year and a half ago, you should have been talking to us and asking about how you do this, By the way, not gonna guarantee that it's free and open forever because, like, lots of people are making money

Them: Mhmm.

Me: on these things. That's good. But kinda mission accomplished now for us.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: That was then, this is now, and we're thinking about licensing Maybe we should be licensing differently for people who are making money than for

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: teachers and people who are free.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: We should be having these conversations in different ways. So we're thinking about all of that at the same time. So definitely that notion is real. And and I think it's the both end is yes. I think we should be having this and we're we're we're having and wanna have more of those conversations publishers and what have you. And OpenSide is one of them.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And the interesting complexity is that to some degree it's hard to know what to bring to them. That's part of what I think we're trying to work through right now. So let's do math. Definitely. KEDOM has taken illustrative math and put it into a plant that's digital and online.

Them: Who has?

Me: Okay, that's meaningful.

Them: Wait. Who has Chad?

Me: It may be that they have felt k I d d o m, Kiddom, is one example, and there's sort of another one ish or so

Them: Okay.

Me: Okay, people are starting to see that packaging may be more valuable to them in some way with some small features, Maybe there's something that they're doing that they're not doing that somebody else might. A platform like Clue, for example,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: could be a thing that encased, you know, and brought whole new realms of

Them: Mhmm.

Me: to something like illustrative math in ways that were haven't really processed entirely yet. You know, maybe that's something to sell to somebody else in a way that wanna make a competitor to what Kiddom is doing or what have you. Maybe that together with what you're talking about is is doubly, you know, valuable. Any of those things are possible. It would be great if in addition to our going to people and saying like, hey, what are you interested in? Or we already have a solution. What's your problem? If we could do some of this user discovery also and say, Ah, we're hearing real problems that are out there for lots of teachers. And we think we've got a solution that matches them but we can't scale that, or we don't have a sales team or something. But if we go to Kit Hom and say,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: people are loving a list of math, they've got this problem. And we think we've got a way to solve that problem. Can we you know, can we make a deal here and

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: some way that lifts you forward and sees an actual problem, and solves it? That

Them: Yeah.

Me: feels like a meaningful place to go. So there's a little both end in that. And even in the open side piece. We had book of gathering, know what to call them, the person that we were consulting with called them symposiums, teacher symposiums, but that doesn't work, we didn't want them to be focus groups. Anyway, we had one of these gatherings at the Tri State Conference down in Rhode Island a week or two ago.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And we were trying to see if people had talked about group work, collaboration, because we're about CLU, trying to see if they're talking about modeling or listening for lots of things. Turned out the thing that everybody nodded about, which was kind of fascinating, I wasn't in the room, but to to Leslie and Dan. One teacher went off and we're using open sciad, we're kind of compelled to use open sciad. It doesn't it's not bad. Like, there was not negativity to her open sciad. But there was a general sense, and nodding in the room, of weariness that open sciad had somehow for them turned into Sage on the stage lecturing. In ways that they didn't like and didn't want. To the degree that at least one of them, and maybe some others, were writing like alternate universe units for their open side unit to make them more engaging and compelling for their students. It was like, Oh, that's really interesting. Especially if the O room is nodding, like, is there something there, for example. That's like a layer that's being missed in some way that maybe we could serve? That that's like, then scalable. It doesn't stop us from going to open side either. But it's a little bit of both the end. Also, it'd be great if we could crack this nut too, but I was talking to Jim from Carnegie seven years ago, and Brian and others going like, I see

Them: Right.

Me: you're building something. You know technology is important. Should do this something. And Brian's like, Yeah, but I'm tired. And Jim's like, Yeah, but it's The States they can only have one computer, and this was pre pandemic, and it's something.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: It was just not that idea of technology, and it was not. Then as things go forward, there were various points, and we talked to Bill and folks, we're like, so tell us your problems. There are two points in this development. Is when you're creating the initial ideas. If you don't know what's possible, you don't dream big enough. Another is soon as you lock in the learning goals, then there's a point to actually pick and choose. Had a couple of those conversations, but not really. And then, you know, my there and didn't build anything overnight and that logo ends. There was lots of weaving and stuff that I think happened, and Things got pulled in various ways. They're not bad, think that CodeApp had Andy behind it in the wildebeest stuff. I think that's probably good. I think in other places, probably misused, but it's not systematic.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: It's not meaningfully integrated. And I feel like we're a long ways down the road to open sci ed sort of waking up and re realizing that. But it doesn't mean that there's not like, aversion. And that was what Jim said to me. Was like, oh, okay, fine. Like he was like, you can always rebuild it. I'm like, yeah, it's so much harder to rebuild something than to do it from the beginning, but okay, whatever. But anyway, there's some way in which that might all layer together in a sandwich. That's really interesting. I have no idea exactly what the ingredients are or what the right layers are, if it's triple decker or not, but there's that there's something with OpenSciad and technology and that current uptake in teacher problems It probably involves some combination of open sided people themselves and going it alone and somewhere in between and testing stuff out, I know. But

Them: Mhmm.

Me: is it as simple as Clue could be pared down to be a really good driving questions board?

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I don't know. So we're searching in those and seven other spaces, and that's the brain dump. Guess end to all those layers. We're not trying to shut any doors at all.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. I mean, it just it just feels like there are multiples of pathways being explored simultaneously.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And a question that comes to mind is,

Me: Yeah.

Them: I would just be curious, and we don't have to do this right now. But I I would be curious about sort of, like, who's doing what You know? So I know

Me: Right.

Them: who to begin conversations with. Right?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And yeah. So at at some point, I'd love to just get a sense for, like,

Me: Yeah. Exactly. No. I think I think we should and and we should, you pull that together. One of the things that I'm trying to to do, and this is much toward the proposal end as anything, but it would start to get rolling, is to get some decent ideation, you know, session on the calendar in the next couple weeks just to start to people thinking about proposals and and, you know, AI in different ways, we call it what you want. Don't know. So what's your life in the next couple weeks if I wanted to make sure I didn't schedule it and find out that you were out of the country or

Them: Yeah.

Me: know, I don't know, whatever.

Them: So next week, we're running a district wide PD and DCPS. So next week is, like,

Me: Mhmm. Good. Yep.

Them: is bad. Week after is the week right before school. So I am actually away that

Me: Okay.

Them: week.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But the week after that is is fine.

Me: Okay.

Them: It's pretty

Me: So September is

Them: And that is not that's, like, the week after two weeks.

Me: right, so September is good. Last week of less so, and beyond that is sort of open ended because it's school and and life

Them: Yeah. I mean, beyond that is basically open. Like, we can schedule

Me: Okay. Right. Okay. That's great. Well, that's really useful.

Them: something beyond that.

Me: I may look at other people's calendars and try to understand, but I think there's at least one, maybe more than one, sort of coming together session where we want to kind of chug through and think about just strategy for proposals slash, you know, what does AI mean for us in various ways? What's the novel take on that

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Because I think to go way back to the very beginning, think it's it's definitely not not AI. And it's also hopefully not the AI that everybody else is trying to propose. Like, what can we propose that's

Them: Mhmm.

Me: different than what other people are? And I think that's gonna be an interesting and harder and and hard not to crack because I because it's just all so new to us, you have to be pretty familiar with it. And nobody's had time to marinate in it. But I think there's something beyond the the chatbot or that we can do with many things. With all of the different, you know, components and sort of software and services and ideas that we have, and we ought to be able to to find some different genres of things. That surprise us if they surprise us, then they can surprise a panel, and that's gonna be the way to stand out because there will be panels with 25 versions of you know, making things more relevant by letting your students chat with us

Them: Right.

Me: something. Like, okay, yeah, I like it. It's important. Sure. But

Them: Right. Right.

Me: there are seven of those.

Them: Yeah. Okay.
