Transcript:

Them: And what if it was only us?

Me: No. Cynthia is here as well.

Them: Hello.

Me: Hello. I think Judi is let's see. Didn't say yes or no. So I will Slack Judi. Let me see how

Them: We're not looking at

Me: no. We're not. I

Them: an agenda document. Right? K.

Me: Just verifying with Judi that she's available because I know she had some call that was running over. And but in the meantime, we can Leslie and I were just talking about the clue website, and they're eight it different things to talk about in there, but the short version of the initial question is that it sounds like Ethan said, yeah. Yeah. Whenever we want, we can just essentially use the code app website as a template or something. Like, he was he was done with using some WordPress, you know, existing template and

Them: Mhmm.

Me: in his mind, that might have been the code app. It doesn't matter to me, but I think, you know, we're all in the same mode of WordPress something, Leslie's working on a first pass, it sort of high level structure for a product page. And then I think we can come together about how much of the the pieces that you've been putting out there fit into a product page and what the goal of that is, etcetera. Cynthia, as we're as we're sort of looking. Because we were we were just discussing, like, okay. Well, it's it's not a project page because we don't really have a project, and we kinda don't know what we're trying to sell about Clue yet either. So we sort of need to get info from teachers anyway, we're also gonna try to figure it out in advance. And we were just talking about the fact that there was lots of that teachers in the focus group this is me paraphrasing Leslie, were not necessarily complaining about group work and collaboration, but did have lots to say about Open Syed and how that was difficult for them in various ways. And so a little bit in the back of our head saying, alright. Is there is there an interesting problem in the open sci ed conundrum for teachers that our things might solve, and maybe there's a clue, you know, a clue sort of foothold in that. Don't really know, but I was just saying that even even something as simple as in these projects, like a driving questions board or something, Like, if you could narrow it down to a really simple thing that people could go, oh, that actually would help me. Be really interesting. So more more to come on that, but I think we'll Leslie will play for another day or two with the product. Page sort of structure or ideas that she's been playing with, and then maybe we can come together around around what to do concretely.

Them: Okay. I think we probably should have another

Me: Yeah.

Them: short meet.

Me: Yeah. No. No. I I think I think so. And and probably probably in a a couple days

Them: I didn't okay.

Me: from now because it sounds like Leslie is, you know, running away at some interesting ideas, and we'll let that let that chug for a day or two.

Them: Yeah. I'm I'm messing about still. But, you know, like, whenever whenever it's

Me: Okay. I'll find I'll find something Wednesday, Thursday or so. Mhmm.

Them: And, Chad, whatever that just one more quick thing. Whatever that

Me: Yeah.

Them: thing you just mentioned about the was it disc discovered questions? What was it? What did you just

Me: I was just I was just talking about the the

Them: I did question right now. Right?

Me: driving question board as something that often gets used in these projects.

Them: Driving question board.

Me: That I think they may be using in OpenSyed. And if so, might be something that, you know, teachers could have as a universal

Them: So I

Me: that

Them: I just wanna it just made me think, driving the question word, that sometimes Concord creates these resources that are definitely out and bigger than projects. So Trudy has often like, Trudy created a summary table

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: for some of her science resources, and teachers loved it.

Me: Yep. That's a very good point.

Them: It's

Me: Mhmm.

Them: but it's very hidden on a collection page for one so, Katrina, were just talking about this the other day about those

Me: And just in thought,

Them: of things that are like, wait a minute. Why are we not sort of cross projects or having teacher resources that are available at a higher level on the STEM resource finder that

Me: Yeah.

Them: teachers can use. Because it's these very high level abstract kinda, like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: it's like, in a way, it's really dorky, the summary, but teachers loved it. So what the hell?

Me: Yeah. Yeah. No. That's great. Well well, I would say surface some of those in general, and those might help feed into this conversation about what, you know, what could generalize for CLU that people would get.

Them: Hi. Sorry. My my other call ran

Me: Hi, Judi. How are you doing? Sorry. We were just that's okay. I figured it would. So we were geeking out on on other stuff that we've been meaning to connect on. Anyway,

Them: over.

Me: So I'm rebooting from vacation. So I just I seized the the moment, seized the calendar invite because I looked back at Granola notes, which said, hey. We wanted to talk about onboarding instead of canceling the meeting. So so I said we should talk about onboarding for Danielle. I More than that, I don't know, and maybe it's a five minute conversation. I'm not sure. I told Leslie to jump in at the beginning, but it might become irrelevant for her instantly. I'm not sure. Was this the way right. Exactly. So part of the conversation was

Them: Well, Leslie's away. Right? Aren't you away then? Well, yeah.

Me: if there's stuff that Leslie should talk to Danielle about, you know, before three she's been here three weeks. You know, we can have a half hour conversation before Leslie goes. On the other hand, that might just confuse Danielle because it's a cart before the horse. So I wanted to, you know, all be in the same place for a minute on on that. But in bigger questions, just what do we need to even what are the categories to think about. Onboarding Danielle and, you know, what are the specifics?

Them: Yeah. Like, if Cynthia were to describe were to be put in charge of an onboarding plan for Danielle, what would that look like if did it?

Me: Right. Right.

Them: What would that look like? Right? Like, I I don't know what you wanna teach her.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: In what order? Right. I yeah. I have no idea. I mean, for me, my

Me: Yeah. What what's your standard onboarding, Judi?

Them: my standard onboarding is, you know, I've already said to Danielle, she's gonna meet in the office on her first day.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So so for me, that's kinda the first thing is getting people come into the office that day,

Me: Yep. That's good. Which is Monday, September 2\. Right? Mhmm.

Them: so that she's meeting face Tuesday, September 2\.

Me: Oh, Tuesday, September 2\. Great. Excellent. Yep. That's good. So we will be here

Them: Monday, the first is Labor Day.

Me: That's good. Yep. Excellent. Mhmm.

Them: I I I just laughed. Emily was born on Monday, September 1 on Labor Day, so every like, seven years, it's just this reminder of, you know,

Me: And very, very ironic ironic

Them: that the universe has

Me: to have a baby on Labor Day too. Right? That's

Them: yes, Yes. The universe has jokes.

Me: Uh\-huh. Good.

Them: So Danielle's gonna come into the office that Tuesday. I figured I would meet her. I would get her her computer. I'd get her set up. We'd get her in paper. I'd go over the generic Concord stuff.

Me: Yep.

Them: And then we need to figure out who is she gonna meet with,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and how much time. And then you know, my thought, Chad, was that you would take her to lunch with a bunch of people.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then I don't know who she needs to meet with that week. That's kind of a

Me: Mhmm.

Them: because my standard would be meet with the person for an hour or so and send them off to whatever PI

Me: Right.

Them: you're working with.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: It is a little different.

Me: Yeah. So it's okay. Yeah. What are what are

Them: Right.

Me: what are top what's top of your head on this all?

Them: One one thing to hop ahead is just all of the things that are in the shared Google Drive folder currently called Concord strategic initiative or strategic developer or something like that. That's because Rick Rick's been working with me for a 100 word description of the Concord consortium that he wants to be able to give to Danielle for all future sort of proposals to foundations or talking points or whatever whatever. And so he literally just asked me sort of hey. Can you find a place for all these files? I'm like, well, they're probably gonna live in strategic development. And my guess is she's gonna get access to the that folder right when she starts. Now

Me: I I

Them: there's one caveat. Right now, there's a folder in there called director development,

Me: Yeah. Sorry.

Them: That's all the candidates in there. So the poll needs to leave right away.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: We need to move that. But then I think that that is where I would like, it's it's trial by let's just, like, jumping in. Here's a bunch of stuff. What we've been working on, you know, for the past two, three months or whatever it is, dumping folders in dumping ideas, dumping words, whatever. So here's a good place to get started.

Me: Mhmm. Yes. I agree on that. So, I mean, I think there's if it think there are two layer probably only two layers. I think there's, like, day one and then beyond, or maybe it's day one, week one, and and beyond. You know, the the day one logistics, I think, are just important just

Them: Right.

Me: to be nice and and to make sure that he gets the the the the rounds. And and the fact that we've been having strategic development things on Tuesdays is a good opportunity to do that. The question of how much of the fire hose to bring her into on that or how to how to schedule that in a way that some part of it is useful for her is a different question, but related

Them: I like the idea of sort of a one day, one week, two week, one month Like, it's I think it's ground running. I mean, you

Me: Yep. Yeah.

Them: have a month, and then she hasn't done not that she's not gonna do

Me: Right?

Them: Like, there have to be, like, right away, I mean, as you know, Chad so we have an email that will go out very soon. So

Me: Yep.

Them: Leslie, Judi, there's gonna be an email that goes out very soon from Mailchimp to 30, 60,000, all of our subscribers. And it's basically gonna say, we need you to donate, like, in a word. Right? And it's either gonna go out in the next week or so or it's gonna go out right after Danielle starts. So that's the deciding point Chad and I talked about this earlier today. But Danielle is either good if it waits for Danielle, that will be one of the first things you need to look at this email. It's gonna have Chad's signature on it, but it's gonna mention Danielle by name. She needs to look at it because she will then kind of take over the the email campaigns. The next email campaign might be giving Tuesday, and she might be the one writing it. Rick and I are the ones who wrote this one. But so

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so, like, you can see that by the end the first week, in my plan, by the end of the first week, Danielle would look at that email, She would have her staff bio on our website along with staff pictures, like beautiful Danielle, our cute little photos like we always do. And so on. So what that by by the end of Friday, she'd have staff bio, staff photo, and this email. And familiarize herself with the Google Docs that all the crap that we've been doing for three months, all the folders and files and everything, she'd just look at them. And be like, woah. And then, you know, by the September, it might be she's already made a plan for the next email campaign.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Like, it just has a calendar. Like, her play her calendar is to make a calendar. Of the next six months of when the next email campaign would go out because that is there's likely gonna be one Giving Tuesday, and then there might be one at the end of the year or something.

Me: Mhmm. Yes.

Them: So that's just one part of her work. She like, no idea of the 8,000,000 other things that she's gonna be doing, connecting with high net worth individuals and know, corporations or foundations or whatever. But those are the things that I know, and then I'm happy to help you know, her with.

Me: Yep. This is good. Yeah. So I'm writing notes in the background here. It feels like it feels like there's a day one, which is, you know, already shaping up pretty decently of, you know, if she meets with you in the morning, Judi, and if we had a strategic development meetings, somewhat over the top of that, but she came in for, like, the last hour hour or so of that. And then we went to lunch. You know, there's probably some natural progression there that might be kind of nice. And then talk about the email to subscribers and maybe that's enough for a day already and give her a homework assignment to look at, you know, here's some things to to look at for an hour or two, but then it feels like day two might be Cynthia, maybe it's you and me and her and Rick and various combinations just kind of getting lay of the land. And by the end of that first week, maybe we're trying to set her up to set set goals for the next month, you know, together with us or something like that. And then by the end of the second week, we're trying to get the calendar for six months and and sort of get that in shape and and some way. And know, beyond that, day one, there's not other stuff for you, Judi. Is there basically giver keys and and computer and sure she knows where the info the the in what do you call that crap?

Them: Intranet.

Me: That's it. Intranet. Wow. How am losing words? I have been on vacation for a week, where where the Internet is and then go from there.

Them: Another thing that I just if you're taking notes on things

Me: Mhmm.

Them: needs to do, Chad, Kylie, Sue, and I have had one sort of official Bloomerang training. I mean,

Me: Yes. Mhmm.

Them: one on one training with a representative, Britney, We've also done or I think we've all done the sort of two and a half hour first module or something like that. This whole bloomer on land learning. Right? We were supposed to set up the second call with Britney by August 14, and we need to ask Britney if we can

Me: Good.

Them: do that after the September something so that Danielle can join us.

Me: Mhmm. Yes.

Them: And then Danielle will need to figure out who she wants on the Concord Bloomerang gang. Like, right now,

Me: Yeah.

Them: as I said, it's Sue, Kylie, and me, but we don't necessarily need four Concord people.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: To look at and BlueMurang, whatever. So Danielle can say, I need one friend or I need three friend, whatever she wants.

Me: Mhmm. Yes.

Them: I don't know. So that has to be that will be very soon. That will be early as a bloomerang call. If she doesn't already know Bloomerang, I don't remember if she does in her resume. But if she doesn't, she oh, she does. Perfect. So she'll this will all make sense to her.

Me: Yep.

Them: Yeah. She does. She was one of the people who actually had another, like, companion tool that she was recommending?

Me: Yeah. There's another one as well in in structure. That's the c that's the LMS, but it's

Them: It's not incremental with that.

Me: Yeah. Instrumentl. Yep. Mhmm. Yep.

Them: That foundation list or something. But

Me: Well, it may be that there's a that that that training goes both directions that we have a loom boomerang training, but she also gives us an walk through or something like that so we understand sort of how that fits into the picture.

Them: Right.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So that's another thing that she will need to do.

Me: Yeah. And then it feels like, you know, there's some subset of PI meetings before too long. Wouldn't have you don't have have them all into a week. But, you know, by the end of the week, having met with a couple PIs, feels like it's the right thing too. So, I mean, we're into a pretty decent first four days for her here where day one is get to know everybody and fire a little bit of fire hose. Day two, maybe it's Rick, Cynthia, Sue, me, you know, and a couple different meetings, and and day three might be, you know, blooming ring and, instrumental and a PI meeting or something like that. And, you know, day four, she's gonna be figuring stuff out. But sprinkle some PI meetings in there.

Them: Yeah. I guess the thing that I'm not hearing and, again, I don't know that it's important that she do this in even her first three weeks, but sooner or later, it seems like she ought to talk to some teachers. Right? Like,

Me: Yeah. Right. Mhmm.

Them: people who use

Me: Yep.

Them: the stuff that we do. And

Me: Yeah. Well, at that point, we

Them: and and learn about that a little bit. So let

Me: should be, you know, god willing, in a place where we're starting to have some of those user conversations, you know, as a matter of course for some of these. So sitting

Them: Right.

Me: on those would be really important.

Them: Is there a Exactly. What about a conference?

Me: Right.

Them: What about just she could just like, I know she wouldn't be able to speak at the con consortium, like, at a booth, but she could if she were sort of a fly on the wall hanging around,

Me: Yeah. So, I mean and so

Them: Right.

Me: basically, looking for those opportunities in the first, you know, few weeks so that she gets to

Them: Right.

Me: from teachers who are our users.

Them: Yes. And I know that, know, like, Kylie was looking at going at that what it was the masked one or something.

Me: Yep.

Them: So, you know, just making sure that if there are some near term arrangements, to be made for that that maybe we haven't made yet, that we make them Like, if we're on the fence about whether or not it would be worth it to sign up for another one of these Maybe this would be a reason to do that if we can find a cheap one.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Mass there's MassQ October 15\. There's Mast November 5\.

Me: Mass is November. Oh, interesting. I thought the masters earlier. Okay.

Them: Yeah. Whichever whichever one cup.

Me: Yep. That's our Exactly. Yep.

Them: I was gonna take that one, so whichever one to go to is okay with me.

Me: Yeah. As long as she's, you know, giving us some meetings with teachers one way or another. And some meetings with PIs and and getting into projects. That's that's all good. Great. That that seems like the right direction. And so the main question there is is gonna be setting up some of those meetings, like the PI meetings and things with her and beyond So we won't have Sarah be setting up meetings, so we'll have to figure out how to to get those things set up.

Them: I think I think I can I can you know,

Me: Yeah.

Them: I can set up meetings? That's not a big deal.

Me: Yeah. I think and and I think you could give her the intro to some of those then in that first day. Say, like, it would be nice if one of the things that, you know, you could do is give her first a schedule for that first week, you know, even if it's just sort of high level blocked out. Know? Here's day one, two, three. We've got a meeting with this person, you know, this PI on Thursday, something like that.

Them: What I was gonna do is I was going to get, we once I had her letter back, which you took care of on Friday night,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: was gonna get the IT ticket in to get her email account set up.

Me: Great.

Them: Even though she won't have access to it yet. And then I have her calendar I can start getting those those meetings scheduled

Me: That'd be great.

Them: even if they're on my Zoom for now.

Me: Yep. I think that'd be perfect.

Them: And, I can actually go in and start those meetings and then make her host.

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: Or make depending on who they're with, make somebody else an alternate host.

Me: Yep. Great. So, yeah, if you set up PM meetings, in that first week one and week two, I don't. I'm just typing into separate notes, but I'll make a document

Them: Have a document, Chad, that you're doing and that you can

Me: for this. Or or if we already have is there any document that we've already had going for any other reason?

Them: Well, I just I just no. I have I had had chat GPT

Me: Next.

Them: make me an onboarding document for the director of development without any info from anywhere.

Me: That's fine. Great.

Them: So it's very not Concord, but it's a start It's at least got a format.

Me: If you if you can put it into a Google Doc and share it, then we can excellent.

Them: I did put it in a Google Doc. So

Me: We can dump this stuff into

Them: let me just have it only share it with you and not who it thinks it should share with. So now well, I'll share it with sharing it with you right now, Chad, but

Me: that's good.

Them: So I would for the AI meeting, Oh, it's shared with a lot of people because I put it in the folder for Danielle.

Me: That's fine. Not a problem.

Them: It what's it called? Onboarding for director of development. Onboarding. Okay. So for PI meetings,

Me: Yeah. I think so.

Them: think it would be Amy, Dan, and Jay to start.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And then I mean, his son will be, like,

Me: Yeah.

Them: that's too much in the first week. So

Me: Exactly.

Them: Right.

Me: Yep.

Them: So he said you'd wait till week two. So meeting with I guess I'm sort of assuming that somebody that's advanced in their career knows how to use know, Google Mail and Google Docs and Google I that's one of the things I will check on. I would hope so, but

Me: Yeah. I want some too. Mhmm.

Them: if not, I will do a quick little tutorial

Me: Yeah. I mean I mean, making sure that she

Them: Well,

Me: knows what all the things are that are important is probably the biggest key. You know, we've been we've been using Granola. We always use Slack. We've got Google Docs, and and a little bit of although you catch that before too long, but a little bit of here's sort of the modes that are working these kinds of things tend to be in Google Docs. These kinds of things tend to be here, etcetera. Mhmm.

Them: Yep. And, you know, we use

Me: Yep.

Them: Slack heavily in this organization, which

Me: Right.

Them: if you're a tech person feels normal, but may

Me: Mhmm.

Them: very bizarre for her. So, you know, just making sure she understands about

Me: Yeah.

Them: different channels and you know,

Me: Yep.

Them: Right? How to get help if she needs it. How to get IT help if she needs it. You know?

Me: Yep. That's good.

Them: Yeah. Those are things I do as part of my onboarding anyhow.

Me: That's great.

Them: Alright.

Me: Okay. This is this is great. I think this is mostly what I was looking

Them: Are you

Me: for. I think we need

Them: Are you stuck with me?

Me: your time or maybe any of ours at this point. I think this is let's see. It seems like yeah. The user meetings are gonna bubble up themselves. I think we answered implicitly the question of you know, do we do you need to meet with her in advance? I think no is the answer there. And if there maybe the only homework on your side, Leslie, is if there's stuff that you wanna make sure that she encounters or deals within the first three weeks before your back, you know, sending those notes on in some way.

Them: I would encourage you to give her Kylie's learn portal treasure hunt that we give all development staff members because it's honestly a great introduction no matter who you are, and it's it's all from the user side. Right? We just get people to walk through

Me: Mhmm.

Them: like, making a student account, making a teacher account, making you know? Right?

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: So you know, I would just just put Kylie on the schedule and I'll I'll make sure that she knows that that's what I'm hoping she will talk to her about and then whatever else they wanna talk about. But

Me: That sounds good.

Them: Alright. So you I'm gonna make sure alright. Include Kai. So I just wanna make sure I know Alright. So I'll I'm setting up those meetings, I'll make sure I include Kylie and schedule one with Kylie.

Me: Yep. Think that's right. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Mhmm. Yep.

Me: Great. That's excellent. And I don't think there's more stuff here. And then just making sure that people will set up the GM so it will work on the day one schedule.

Them: Alright. Cheers,

Me: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Yeah. I can stay on Judi. Yep.

Them: Alright. Chad, can you stick out

Me: Yep. No problem.

Them: for one second just so I can

Me: Thanks, Cynthia. Yep.

Them: All set? Okay. Bye. Thanks. Just so I can just check\-in a couple of things with you.

Me: Exactly. I I was getting getting revved up on Slack this morning, so I didn't answer

Them: Do we have I know. Well and I I had

Me: some stuff.

Them: I had a whole Slack thing for you that I actually purposely didn't hit send on till this morning.

Me: Fine. Yeah. I know. I I happen to see that in your calendars. I was rearranging things. I was like, oh, Well, we'll gotta check\-in. So we don't yet

Them: Do do we have times for the board meeting?

Me: I can but we know generally how long it's gonna be, what yes. So I can propose those to Helen by text cause I don't meet with her until Wednesday.

Them: Okay.

Me: And try to nail it down in in advance of of Wednesday.

Them: That would be great. I'm just I'm just trying to figure it out because Lisa's not here.

Me: Alright.

Them: Lisa's off. I know people are gonna be like,

Me: It's totally there.

Them: we haven't gotten anything. It was I'm supposed to get something a month before.

Me: Yep. Exactly. Yep. I've

Them: I wanna get the invite out at least for the times.

Me: fully, fully agree. Yes. So I will I'll put that on my schedule today.

Them: And I didn't know if you and Helen had talked that you were thinking it was gonna be two hours or four hours or

Me: It's probably between two and three. And so maybe we'll propose three and I think that's yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll text with Helen, but I think we'll we'll probably in that case, I might propose three and have people pleasantly surprised. Because it's just a call. Actually, it's a call. So we might even be able to just propose two hours. We'll see. But I'll I'll check with Helen. Right. I agree and make it shorter.

Them: I would rather we propose it for three and let

Me: Yep.

Them: send an invite for three and then let the agenda be shorter.

Me: I agree with you on that as well. Okay. Great. I will

Them: So I really just need you and Helen to decide if you want it to be one to four or two to five.

Me: check with her on that. Oh, shoot.

Them: Bummer. I should have talked to you before I canceled my dentist appointment.

Me: Alright. Exactly.

Them: That's alright. The last thing I wanna do is be on 01/28 on a Friday.

Me: Okay.

Them: So alright. So, yes, if you can just confirm that with her, I wanna get that out.

Me: Yep. Totally agree. Okay.

Them: I know Sue was working on her finance documents before she left.

Me: Right. Yeah. I saw that. That's fine. So

Them: I'm not working Fridays.

Me: yep.

Them: So I just wanna

Me: Yep. And I'm gonna I'm gonna get my documents nailed down in the next day or so so I don't have too much other stuff. And I'm just getting coming back. So and I don't think it'll be too extensive. So I think it'll be pretty straightforward this time.

Them: Okay.

Me: But Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Just I just didn't want you and I to be

Me: Mhmm. With

Them: I just I just wanna make

Me: with this yeah. Yeah. With this call, it's not gonna because

Them: sure that we're not crazed on Thursday.

Me: it's it's a call instead of something. It won't be quite as big, and we generally have an agenda already set to go. So I'll I'll look at that.

Them: Angie just

Me: Exactly. Let me just

Them: and you just had a call on the thirty first. So

Me: you know, people are many of them are up to speed, and those who aren't are we're gonna review what we did. So It was good.

Them: k. So did you look at vacation? Were you able to

Me: Yeah. I definitely did. I mean, we didn't do a lot, but we were down in DC, and

Them: really disconnect?

Me: we'd, you know, did a little bit here and there. And it was very open and weird. I think the the the tourism I mean, sometimes August might be a low time. It sounds like, well, at least local people, but they don't on the mall anyway. But there was nobody there. While we walked around the we're like, this is crazy. Like, we found parking spots that were open in Downtown DC, which you never ever ever find. And we went in, like, we

Them: No.

Me: took a day, we're going to a couple museums. And then on a whim, we're like, oh, let's go to the the archives, which is usually like a three hour line And we just walked straight in And there was, like there were, like, 20 people there, and all we're just, like, look. There's the declaration of independence. So you basically walked right up to it. Normally, it's, like, four people deep, and you can't get in. So we're like, oh, we take advantage of all the things we should have gone up the Washington Monument too because somebody on the subway was like, I got tickets. And, like, we never get tickets. So the to go up the monument. So we took advantage of some of the fact that there weren't a lot of tourists around. It was fun.

Them: Wow.

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: That's great.

Me: So it was good. Saw some of the new stuff there.

Them: That's great.

Me: Space, they opened they're opening some new rooms, sort of remodeling it. So we we did a did a few fun museum things here and there, so it was good. Yeah.

Them: That's great.

Me: Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. That never happens. That never happens. That's it. Well, I was talking to my

Me: Mhmm.

Them: friend who leads all the trips to Egypt.

Me: Yeah.

Them: The person from here who leads them. I said, oh, someone I work with is

Me: Yep.

Them: about Egypt for the eclipse. She said,

Me: I'm sure.

Them: it is gonna be a zoo.

Me: Yeah.

Them: She said, If he's really thinking he should start doing his planning now,

Me: Yeah. I'm I'm aware of eclipse planning. I mean, it we're it's already late because it's not three years in advance, although you can't always book things more than one year in advance. But

Them: Right. But but she said, yes. She said if you're going to do it and she did say and she said, oh, tell me if I should have you be in touch with Ehab or Emil, but I'll

Me: Okay.

Them: figure out which one. But she said if you are gonna do it, you would want to

Me: Oh, yeah. Mhmm.

Them: start planning now. Because it's only people from The US that are worried about going to Egypt right now.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Egypt is incredibly safe.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Which we knew when we were there.

Me: Yeah. Exactly.

Them: She was there when was she there? Oh, she was there last November.

Me: Mhmm.

Me: Sure.

Them: She wasn't gonna back out, but people on her trip backed out. But I just wanted to share that with you that she said, yes.

Me: Yeah.

Them: You know, if you're gonna do it, that now would be the time because

Me: Yeah. Yeah. No. There was a there was a New York Times story today where they interviewed

Me: you know, the random readers, and they had 21 different ways that people are using it from, you know, organizing wine choices for a supplier of wines to, you know, people who are, you know, planning planning things. It was a really good rundown of how people are finding unique ways to use it. Yeah.

Them: Aditi, I I'm just bringing it up to you. I think she'll bring it up anyhow. She does not necessarily wanna conquer computers. She was just concerned about

Me: Okay.

Them: data on her MIT one. I told her to talk to you.

Me: Okay. Sure. Fine.

Them: About security, about that, and what your thoughts were.

Me: Mhmm. Okay.

Them: The other thing is she is pregnant.

Me: Good.

Them: She will share that with you herself. But she was asking about leave. And from my perspective, because she will not have been here twelve months,

Me: Right.

Them: there is no leave, and it's she's under 50%.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I said I did not think it would be an issue, but I to talk you and Sue because she's not working. We can't charge for her time because

Me: Right. Right. Yep. Sure.

Them: won't be getting paid.

Me: Yeah.

Them: I mean, I don't think that's an issue. I think

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, Sue will have to figure out dollars.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Okay.

Them: But it's up to you if there's anything you want her to still participate in project.

Me: That's fine.

Them: Wise. I also told her that any meetings so if there are any meetings you want her to attend whether either during that time or in general?

Me: Okay.

Them: That's the guidance she's gonna be looking for from you.

Me: That's good to know.

Them: Other than all hands, I said I had nothing. But that you might have PI meetings. Like, I don't know if you want her in c four I don't know if you

Me: We're still figuring out what the right meetings are to to have. So

Them: so so that, also, Danielle, I don't know

Me: Yeah.

Them: you're gonna add Danielle to court at some point, but I didn't think that would be right away.

Me: Probably Yep. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: Kathy. Oh, Kathy.

Me: K.

Them: Kathy came in We could not get Kathy's old MacBook Air.

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: For some reason, we could not get it to connect to the

Me: K.

Them: to the

Me: Gaurus.

Them: to in source. We got her email working. But the fact that they could not go in and take control of it to help her,

Me: I have

Them: said, we're not giving her back that computer.

Me: Yeah. Yes. I agree. Mhmm.

Them: I just can't have them not be able to help her.

Me: Right. Exactly. I

Them: So they took one of the computers that was there,

Me: and then, of course, it was too heavy. Yeah.

Them: They reset it up for her. It took forever. It took forever, but they did do have she does have a Mac.

Me: Yeah.

Them: It's working. They are able to screen into her and take control and make it all work. She's not happy with me. Because it is not the old MacBook Air, and it

Me: Right. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: weighs a little more. I'm sorry.

Me: Exactly. I'm sure it's not 10 pounds, of course.

Them: It's not does not weigh 10 pounds. I I did not know that she had a weight restriction be you know, whatever before.

Me: And that's all I know. Right.

Them: If

Me: And then the weight restriction is not gonna last forever either. So

Them: she's only gonna be here for eight months, I'm not going out

Me: Yep.

Them: right. So my thought was her MacBook Air, is back there, and they can wipe and

Me: Okay.

Them: clear and start from scratch. We will give to Danielle.

Me: That's probably fine. We should we can check with her and make sure that's good. But yeah. Mhmm. Sure.

Them: Unless Danielle says, no. I don't want a Mac. I want a

Me: No. Right. Exactly. That's one question. But if she wants a Mac, then it's fine as long as yeah. That's

Them: PC.

Me: that's fine. I mean, if the error is a good new ish compute new computer, then that's Okay. Okay. Great. That's good then.

Them: It's brand new. Kathy had it for two months. So

Me: Good. Good.

Them: that's I just wanted you to be up to date on the Kathy thing because you know, I

Me: Alright. Yes.

Them: I just don't want her to come to you and you to be caught in

Me: It's good good to know all the pick all the the pick pieces of that. No question.

Them: something you don't know the background on. So she already tried to go to sue about it and Sue said, she also made a comment to Sue about her not being able to get her computer because I had told her it'd already been repurposed.

Me: Right.

Them: And Sue said, oh, I'm sure you've already discussed it with Judi. She would be in charge of

Me: Good. Good. I'll say the same. Yep.
