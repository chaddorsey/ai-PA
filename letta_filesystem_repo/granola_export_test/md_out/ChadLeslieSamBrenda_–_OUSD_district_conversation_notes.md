\#\#\# District Technology Infrastructure \& Resource Management

\- Oakland USD operates as “Google district” \- all students have Gmail, Google Drive access

\- Single sign\-on system with student emails activated in 6th grade

\- Elementary students limited to Clever dashboard access

\- District boundaries prevent external logins on OUSD Chromebooks

\- LMS usage varies by level:

\- Elementary: Primarily Clever dashboard

\- Middle school: Schoology adoption

\- High school: “Wild west” \- mix of Google Classroom, Schoology, or no LMS

\- Resource adoption happens through multiple channels:

\- Official district approval process for paid resources (requires data privacy agreements)

\- Teachers independently finding/using free tools (common practice)

\- Default is open access unless specifically blocked

\#\#\# Current CodeApp Implementation \& Usage

\- Used across 8\-9 middle school computer science teachers with varying fidelity levels

\- Integrated into data science curriculum unit developed with WestEd partnership

\- Students create data visualizations, struggle with saving/sharing work to Google Drive

\- Google’s sharing process creates barriers for student workflow

\- Teachers provide feedback within platform when possible, otherwise through Schoology/Google Classroom

\- Grade translation requires manual entry into Aries SIS from multiple platforms

\#\#\# Pain Points \& Desired Improvements

\- Integration challenges between platforms (CodeApp, \[code.org](http://code.org), Aries don’t interface)

\- Complex multi\-step processes for saving student work

\- One\-to\-many screen sharing limitations affect classroom collaboration

\- GoGuardian now enables teacher to display student screens

\- Need for real\-time comparison of different student approaches

\- Teachers overly focused on grades rather than learning insights

\- Lack of seamless feedback mechanisms across different tools

\#\#\# Expansion Opportunities Beyond Computer Science

\- High school senior capstone projects show need for data literacy

\- Current projects use basic Google Forms charts with insufficient sample sizes

\- Humanities teachers need accessible data analysis tools

\- CodeApp’s drag\-and\-drop interface suitable for non\-technical teachers

\- Cross\-curricular potential in science and social studies classes

\- “Data Fridays” concept \- 45\-minute modules for broader teacher adoption

\- Would need support materials and conversation guides

\- Access to clean, appropriately\-sized datasets crucial

\#\#\# Professional Development \& Funding Context

\- Salesforce funding (10\+ years) supports:

\- Sam’s coordinator salary and middle school CS teacher positions

\- Monthly STEM PD (2nd Wednesday) \- now includes science teachers

\- Summer professional development programs

\- No curriculum purchases (\[code.org](http://code.org) remains free choice)

\- Brenda’s position funded through CTE rather than core science support

\- WestEd partnership for curriculum development and evaluation

\- Internal PD design with occasional external thought partners

Transcript:

Me: Hello. Hello. Hello. Long time no see. How's it going?

Them: Everybody. You know, school is starting, things are happening. It's crazy, but

Me: I'm sure that's true. Yeah. What what's the what's the first day?

Them: what we can do. Thursday was two weeks ago.

Me: Oh my goodness. I didn't realize you started that early.

Them: So we're into oh, yeah.

Me: Oh,

Them: Ridiculously early, and it makes no sense to me.

Me: I'm sure. When do you get when do you get done? And

Them: May.

Me: in May, June? May. Holy craps.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Wow.

Them: Which I don't know if you know, like,

Me: California.

Them: June is kind of a miserable month here. It'd be a nice time to be in school.

Me: Uh\-huh. Right.

Them: August is a nice time to, like,

Me: Yes.

Them: be out in the world. So nobody seems to be listening to me about that, but

Me: Yeah. I know. I lived in in Oregon, and, you know, September was the best

Them: yeah.

Me: month of the year also at the time. And didn't mean you had it to to do anything with, so I agree. Mhmm. I assume we're waiting on Brenda. If not,

Them: Hello?

Me: let me know, and we'll dive in. But and

Them: I don't know. I'm I'm

Me: and She said yes on the invite, but that doesn't

Them: it's been a little crazy for us, but yeah, I think she will

Me: necessarily mean one thing or another. So

Them: can

Me: Sure. That's fine. Either way.

Them: give her a minute. I'll send her a message to see if she's still. How are things for you all?

Me: Going well. It's a little bit less crazy given that we're not in the middle of a school, but it doesn't mean that years aren't crazy for their own reasons at this time of year. Mhmm.

Them: How has how have you been doing with funding stuff? Have you had a bunch of you gotten caught up in all of that?

Me: We I mean,

Them: Doge and all the other

Me: not get caught up is the short answer. We have been caught more leather shoelaces than the the waist We've had one thing that was terminated, but it was near its close. And other things, not so much. So we as I say, in Minnesota where I grew up, it could be worse. But but it is where it is. Now we're waiting on things to be awarded, which is they're taking their

Them: Yeah. I feel like that's a whole

Me: sweet time with as well. So we'll we'll see.

Them: that's the whole other conversation of, like,

Me: Yeah.

Them: yeah. So

Me: Exactly. Hi, Brenda. How are doing?

Them: Doing fine. Happy

Me: I guess so. We were realizing I would like we're in Massachusetts blissfully unaware here. We don't start until next

Them: 2526 school year.

Me: Wednesday is my son's registration day. And Thursday next Thursday is the first day of school, so we're still

Them: Mhmm.

Me: fully in summer mode, but I won't talk about that because I know you're not.

Them: Nice.

Me: Anyway, thanks for giving us little bit of your time. We were sort of interested in following up I mean, yes, and proposal, we'll we'll be able to talk about some of those things more, I think, with WestEd folks. But, I was interested in, I think, a couple directions, both sort of in the same zone. So as we were talking about things in the past with what happened, what you've been doing across the school and what one of the strains that came out, you know, for me, is one we've been interested in is just sort of how schools and you manage, you know, online resources and connecting with them and dealing with them across multiple teachers because we have codep but also other resources, and we are interested in how those sorts of things roll out to lots of people and, you know, LTI and Clever and things like that. The people use. We're interested in their experience there. We're hoping to, you know, get a little pick your brain a little bit just to understand

Them: Sure.

Me: your experience from admin and from teacher side of things. And then there's a little bit of another bubble on just thinking about your wishes and dreams about Cordat that we talked about before and if there were ways to, you know, understand that better and

Them: Nice.

Me: there might be legs on that too. So two strands of conversation, but also open to anything that you're interested in at the same time. Mhmm. And let's say introductions before you know who I am,

Them: Okay.

Me: let me introduce Leslie, and let her introduce herself at least.

Them: Hi. I'm Bondaryk, and I'm the chief technology officer at the Concord Consortium. And I've been trying to help Chad help more districts. Right? You know, we make lots of cool stuff. I know I supervise it. But, you know, if you can't gracefully get it into your classroom, then it doesn't do anybody any good. So I'm here to try and understand that workflow. Chad, does it make any sense for us to work forward? This

Me: I think we could. If you guys if you guys don't mind, we're trying to gather this info

Them: just because these guys might It's fine.

Me: from lots of people. Awesome. We will

Them: Recording in progress.

Me: do

Them: Some sometimes there's a screen share or something that is not something I could just capture and note

Me: Right.

Them: Right? So

Me: Yep. Yeah. And Sam and Brenda gave Leslie a little bit of background, but give your one or two sentence who who you say you are to people.

Them: Depends on who's asking.

Me: Right. Yes.

Them: I'm Sam Berg. I coordinate computer science in OSD, so trying to figure out, like, what computer science looks like k 12\. And, also, I think the way they've sort of involved in this work is where does where does computer science or computer science ideas fit core curriculum? So with data science, like, where are we looking at things? In a science class, something you might learn in some computer science class that you're taking the science class or something that you, are looking at in math or social science. So and then what are the tools that we could give to folks to say, like, hey. We know you had students for their capstone survey a bunch of people. Like, here's a better way to do it than Google Sheets. There's this thing called code app. And so, like, to think about, like, how that kind of stuff works to get get those ways of thinking both k 12, but also, like, spread across across subject areas.

Me: That's great.

Them: So I'm Brenda Tuohy. I work with Sam. I'm a district instructional coach. I support computer science and engineering teachers. I'm a former elementary science teacher myself. And I first I first met Codep. Few years ago, we did a project develop a unit of study on data science from middle school, and we're trying to find figure out what's the right tool. And like, Sam's a computer science person by training. I'm a computer science person kinda by serendipity, I would say. And so, like, Bond thing is somebody who's a computer science learner I think the elegance of Kodap is that it's it's it's very accessible for somebody who doesn't have a lot of experience with data science, with computer science, with programming, but you can get to pretty high level It's a way to analyze data in a sophisticated way without having a lot of sophisticated knowledge.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And so I I just think it's it's there's it's got a lot of potential. So that's that's that's me.

Me: That's

Them: And why and why I love CodeApp, which wasn't the question. But

Me: that's okay. No. Actually, it's very useful

Them: More about it.

Me: introduction

Them: It.

Me: overall. So one of the things that you both were sort of alluding to is the fact that, you know, you think about resources and getting them out to lots of teachers And, you know, we're we're interested in sort of you know, maybe first of what what mechanisms you have to do that if I'm a teacher and I'm trying to use a resource do I, you know, just ask for it? Do I go in and find it on Do I go into a system Is there an LMS that people use for any LMS that people don't use for anything? Yeah.

Them: I don't know how much you understand about Oakland. But everybody here does everything all the time. And so there's, like,

Me: I'm sure I'm sure.

Them: yes and no to all of that. There are some there are some, like, different schools have different LMSs. There's, like, sort of a central and we're not a part of that Like, more like Instructional technology. Instructional tech team that that that approves apps and, like, says like, oh, these are the ones you should use. These are the ones that are on the clever dashboard. I will say Clever is used pretty regularly by elementary schools and that dashboard. It's it's the you go up, the less it gets. There's also a lot of teachers that find a thing and are like, hey. I wanna use this. And they get the free version or the kids, and they they have kids sort of log in. One of the things I learned is if you do wanna have, like, we we set up a small contract with the company to provide some services for us. And then at that point, when I tried to pay for something, a whole lot of things the company had to have, like a data sharing a data privacy agreement and all these things. And they were super it was started off former teacher of ours. He was very new and, like, didn't have that. But there's, like, a process to that. If I was a teacher, I could just I'm not supposed to, but a lot of people have a thing that they've, like, I found this somewhere. Somebody sent this to me. Every all of the kids log in to that. So it's it's sort of a mishmash of, like, how info gets out, what people use. There's not there's not, like, you there's supposed to be lanes, not always followed, I guess, is what I would say to that. Yeah. And part of it is in our district. Sam, is it six grade when students' emails are activated? Yes. You get email Yeah. So students all have, like, their email that you they use for their single sign on, but they don't even know they don't have access to that until they're in middle school. So that's so in elementary school, they're all limited to Clever. They access everything through Clever. Yes. And then those emails, when you're on the district system, you can only get to certain things. So, like, you can't put in like, I can't log in to an OUSD Chromebook without an OUSD email. So students are like, in that ecosystem. There are some boundaries on it. The other thing about us is that we are Google district. So kids have Gmail, they have Google Drive, some people some classrooms teachers use Google Classroom whereas others use a Schoology or something like that. So

Me: And that and that decision is by teacher, by

Them: cool.

Me: Is there professional development or incentive or desire to use one system versus another for those school classroom Schoology?

Them: Tools make I think middle school has decided that they're using Schoology. I think some people then still choose to use school Google Classroom or at least one teacher that was talking about still uses Google Classroom. I don't know if this school also doesn't use Schoology and just uses Google, or he just likes Google. Classroom better, High school's a little more, wild west in terms of, like, if they have a LMS, if they don't have an LMS, like, what what exists there? But everybody has everybody the one thing that everybody does have is is Google products, Google Drive, Google Sheets, access to all those kind of things. Which they lose at the end of high school which is sometimes a little bit of a thing, but it is a it is a, like, once you graduate, you no longer have an account. So if you wanted to pull something from your Google Drive, you should have downloaded that. Should have downloaded that, which almost no one does, and then sad about later. Right. Which is a different kind of problem. Yes. But for the duration of time from, like, school on, if if a teacher wanted to something or if, Brenda, you wanted to push something out to a bunch of teachers, you could guarantee be able to do it if it was accessible Google Drive. Yes. Mhmm. The accessibility in Google Drive is, like, the key to the whole system because people end up linking things from Google to their Schoology or if they have a different illness or their Google Classroom. There used to be some Canvas stuff, but also then with some time, people would link Google Docs and all that. Stuff too. So that's that's kind of the the one constant in the a system that has a lot of different factors going on.

Me: And it sounds as if there aren't it sounds as if there aren't necessarily either consistent barriers or consistent accelerants to adopting something. The barriers maybe if if there's money involved, it sounds like there's a a wall of barriers. But it sounds as if the, you know, things I just found don't necessarily have barriers in reality even if they might on paper.

Them: Yeah. The only every once in a while, some things get blocked. But, like, it's more like trying to block games or things like that. I think most most things that are involved like, it's I think I think the default is it's open. And then specific things get blocked. If, if people complain or or they see that, like, a lot of people are going to this.

Me: You're talking about digital access to digital resources and talking about things much of the time, does that mean that that's the digital resources that get used, or are there curricula or examples of times when people are using digital resources sort of part of an ongoing customer experience as opposed to here's an app I like or something like that. And if so, is that different in terms of how it gets connected, rolled out, whatever? Mhmm.

Them: So, for example, we use code.org for our wait for our curriculum in middle school and in high school. Kids log on coda.org through their platform, and then they do their work in that space. So that exists. There's also adopted math curriculum which has I I don't know that we have the online we use I'm I don't know if we have the online

Me: K.

Them: access as well. But also use that mouse. The Desmos platform, which, I think there is some online stuff that we don't don't subscribe to about for that piece. And then some of the other there's and other subject areas there's also some both physical materials and some online materials as well. Those curriculum not code.org, but, like, I am the English curriculum fish tank. The science curriculum, those have all been adopted by board. And so we have a board there's a process to go through the board. There's a contract. Here's what that means, kind of, like,

Me: Mhmm. But it sounds like, you know, I would be much more likely to find a paper or text for any of those things, and a student wouldn't four days out of the week be turning in assignment online that they've been doing in a consistent curriculum. It's not like the digital curriculum is the norm or anything, it sounds like.

Them: It's in a I mean, my my high school kids are doing a lot of their work online.

Me: Okay. Right.

Them: I would say more work than I feel like is pedagogically sound, because it's easier for teachers. Yeah.

Me: But is that an individual feature created as opposed

Them: Yeah. Kids spend a lot of time Yes.

Me: I'm logging on to the Pearson textbook and their system four times a week or something? Like that. It's teachers give online assignments and turn them in online. It's oh,

Them: Yes. Yeah.

Me: That's interesting.

Them: Oh,

Me: Okay. What what am I missing now, Leslie? Go.

Them: How much customization are people doing? Like, if know, if you find a really great curriculum or tool or whatever, know, are they just using things that other people have said, yeah. Here's way the lesson goes, or are they, you know, branching out? Can you say that one more time?

Me: You mean provide

Them: Sorry.

Me: professional resources that they're modifying? Is that what you're asking about? Or

Them: Yeah. Right. Like, if if you've got a a Pearson tool, that the district has adopted, let's say, are they just following along with the program exactly as

Me: Yeah.

Them: identified, or do they make their own stuff? I would say, like, Sam and I, both as, like, just, like, curriculum people, like, we wish the teachers would use the curriculum they had more. Oh, yeah. They're like, is there a lot of innovation? Yes. There a lot of flexibility? Yes. Are people just, like, using things that they find all the time? 100%. And I think, honestly, a lot of that comes to lack of time and resources for professional development. That teachers don't often don't even know. What's available to them or haven't had the experience to really kind of, like, dig in and see how instructionally sound it is. It's like, stop finding stuff that you made up on the Internet. Yeah. Well, okay. But yes and. Yes and. Yes and I want to meet these folks where they are. Right? So doing this, then there's something about that model that works for them. Which I wanna respect. If so there they are, and they're sitting at their their desk at home the night before, and they're like, I gotta get all my kids to do a thing. What do they do? Do they make a Google Sheet with the instructions? For login and etcetera? Like, they need kids to log in to a a thing. Sure. Often, it could be, like, a Bitly or if you have Google Classroom or Schoology or something like that, you can just make a Google Doc or a worksheet. Put the link in there, and then kids will click on it to get it. Get into that space. Right. Right. The other thing that I think so that's can be tricky. The other thing that's tricky

Me: Right.

Them: is when you want the kids to save their work or turn something in, like,

Me: Gonna ask about that. Mhmm.

Them: Mhmm. How to get back through like, that was a thing that came up when we were using CodeApp was, like, kids made a thing, and it's like, okay. Now they wanna share it to their dry. Then there's a couple different steps. I think we talked about that, and you said that was on Google's, like, Google made that process hard, and so that was a that was a thing. But yeah.

Me: Is there a consistency to how people, I mean, so is that a pain point turning things in and and for whom and why?

Them: It's a pain point if you're not in something. Let's easily put into the Google into Google Drive. So if it was a it's an outside app, to get the work into the Google Drive where then you can share it and do all those things. That can be tricky. And, I think there are folks that are like, it's not worth it because I can't get it across this barrier.

Me: If it's, if I can do that, and get my students turn something on Google Drive, what do I do with it then? Do I grade it? And if so, how do I get feedback to them about that It's it's such a alright. I mean, just got a whole bunch of Google Docs or PDFs. Right?

Them: Yeah. That's why, like, a lot of teachers that use Google Class room because then students are submitting the assignment and then teacher like, are you familiar with the, like, the back end of Google Classroom? So then, like, that's where teachers will get the comments, and the kids can see it. All, like, through Google Classroom or Schoology or Google Yeah. That Yeah. Same that often it's inside of that whatever that platform is that they're using.

Me: So if they're giving digital fee so it sounds like they're giving digital feedback and it sounds like most of them are in some way or another giving feedback digitally on some digital assignment that's turned in. You know, semi frequently at least a couple times a week maybe. If maybe once a week. If they're doing that, they're doing that feedback their platform of choice, and they need something that can be turned in on that platform of choice.

Them: Yes. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. Whereas, like, on the code.org and the code.org ecosystem, they're often just doing it inside because that feature exists within code.org. So they're they're saying, like, oh, okay. Like, I'm looking at your program now, and there's a place where you you can write some comments or or or and so that's just happening. And then that is getting sent to the student that way.

Me: Through code.org.

Them: So if it's like if it's if if that option exists in the platform, I think teachers are doing it there. If it doesn't, they're doing it through a Schoology or a Google Classroom or a I don't know I don't know what other LMSs we're using right now, but that that space.

Me: What happens at grades time? Do I sit there with three laptops and translate across from all my platforms into a grade book, or have I kept my grade book on the side, what you know, how do I deal with that? Mhmm. Okay.

Them: Maybe it goes to another platform. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. But and so I am every night or every week, I'm sort of looking across what my students did that week and saying, alright. They got seven on this and 10 on that and turning it into my grade book.

Them: Yeah. So I think there's a there's another platform called Ares, which is where we take attendance and that also has the grades in it.

Me: SIS. Right?

Them: Yeah. The SIS. And so then teachers they didn't have various ways. Some people have, a Gradebook in Google Classroom, and then they just port that over. Some people are like, okay. Now I'm going going through and entering the grades in Aries. As time goes on. I don't know like, my kid is in middle school. I see his grades in Schoology. Each week, it sends me a thing that says, this is how he did in that. I don't know if that's linked to Ares or if you have to like, take those and then manually enter them into Ares. Like, I don't know how that interaction happens. With those with if which platforms were together, which ones don't, and and what how complicated it is get them to work together is, I think, another question.

Me: If you were waiving a magic wand about adoption or use of digital resources or one that could reduce the the things that you grumble about when you're, you know, closing the door at night? What what what it be? What's the thing that you would try to to take away or fix or change You can miss more than one if you want.

Them: I mean, I I think just more seamless integration would be a nice between platforms. Like, I don't think code.org interfaces with Ares. I that thing last year when we were trying to do the the saving stuff in code app. Doing some Lego projects right now, and kids are gonna code but then it's we're checking, like, how what what's it look like to be able to code to save that? You could come back to it the next day? It's not impossible, but it's like four steps. You know? And if you have a class of 30 and there's five people who wanna do it, you know, like, it just it just it takes a while to get to that spot. And I think I think there's that. I think the other thing is ease of use in terms of, like, getting feedback to students How how can you look at how can you look at examples of, like, what's happening and give a kid feedback or how can students look at each other's work and give each other feedback? Like, what is that? Like, what does that look like? And then I also think is a question that that's, like, where I sit, but there's teachers that probably have different pain points. And and would probably give really different answers. So I don't know what's what do you think, Brenda? I mean, so my kid just started public school, but she's in pre k. So this could change. But from as a former elementary teacher who spends a lot of time coaching middle high school teachers. I think they're overly fixated on grades. And so, like, for me, I would be interested in like, technological tools that give teachers kind of insight into what kids are doing. So, like, insights that will guide their instruction rather than kind of, like, completion and grades. Teachers are always like, but how do I grade this? I'm like, it doesn't matter. I don't care about what are they learning? What are they doing? So I'm thinking about, like, something CodeApp. I think it would be interesting You know, if there was some kind of I don't even know if I'm sure it's possible somehow, but some kind of summary of, like, you gave the kids a task and these are the tools that they use. Like, this is what 24 out of 25 students played around with a different axis. Axises. You know? Couple students looked at like, measures central tendency. Couple students kind of went in to figure out formulas or some kind of way to, like, at a glance, see how students are using it. So as a teacher, you have a little bit more information than just what you notice walking around. Like, that could be I feel like that would be, like, a way that the the technology could enhance the teaching and the learning. That would be interesting. Makes me think the other thing I have a kid that's in eighth grade and a kid that's a junior. As a parent, I don't know that this is a compelling feature for schools or teachers, but it would be interesting to be able to see kind of what they're like, is there a is, like, there a parent view where you could be like, oh, this is what your kid did today. Like, I don't need to get into the whole, like, the guts of everything, but, cool. Like, and I'd be like, awesome. Let me ask him a question about that when he comes home tonight, you know, or

Me: Alright.

Them: kinda see about that. And I I see things

Me: Mhmm.

Them: like, I can sometimes see some stuff in Schoology, but it would be it's hard to navigate that, and that's more of a Schoology issue. But if there was an easy way to, like, push a thing out, that might be an interesting an interesting thing as well.

Me: Right. So it sounds like both of those are sort of the artifacts of learning in process and after. Sorry, Leslie.

Them: I just I wanna follow\-up on something I think I heard you say earlier. It seems like you're interested in peer to peer review or, like, your students being able to collaborate. Or can you can you say some more about that? I think one of the things that often happens with technology is sometimes it's like one kid, one screen. And so where's that conversation piece happening? And you can do some things as a teacher where it's you know, two kids on one computer or or looking at different looking there's some apps that where it's like, let me show this kid's work on the board right now. Without having to like, we now use GoGuardian and I think that offers that feature. It used to be the kid used to, like, have to come plug their computer into the the projector to be able cable. Yep. Yeah. So it's like, like those kind of things, where there's opportunity for a kid to say, like, this is what I did. And have other kids have be able to look at the thing and then be able to talk about it. We first did the data science unit, it was it was, like, poor planning on our part, but there were some kids that had done this thing on code app, and they were each talking about their thing. But nobody could see what they were talking about. It was one of the weirdest, most bizarre, and yet I was like, this gets kinda tried to hang with the conversation, but they didn't give any context either. Were just like, this is what I and it was like, really funny about kind of like what happened Had and that was before there was, like, an ability to, like, oh, let's flash that kid's graph up on the screen. Then let's have that let's ask questions about let's have that conversation about that. And I think we could do that now with GoGuardian. Mhmm. These these could we're not Chromebooks. We couldn't even do the HDMI cable. So it was, like, we're really stuck in in figuring out how to help kids have a thing they could then have a larger conversation about.

Me: Do you think teachers are ready to orchestrate that you think there are things that would help them deal with that in real time? I mean, there's there's a whole other dimension of that. And maybe it's exactly what we've always done, but it's not entirely right. In in real time in the classroom. What would help them if so, what would help them? Mhmm.

Them: I think it depends on the teacher. I think there's some that are very ready to lead those conversations and have those artifacts. I think we have some folks that are sort of uncomfortable having some of those conversations. And so then there's some folks that are a little more uncomfortable with the technology and what it would take to do that. So there's just kind of three camps of that. It's also the sort of thing where I think if people were doing it and it it's like, oh, I I saw so and so do I could probably do that to you know, like, it might seem somewhat intimidating to some folks in the beginning, but over time, or with some professional development, it's like, oh, okay. Here's how here's what this could look like.

Me: Yeah. That's it.

Them: Here's how this would happen in the classroom. Again, you know, like,

Me: Like a meme. Sometimes students even say, hey. Can I plug can I show it up on that? And then, like, oh,

Them: just yeah. Yeah. Like,

Me: it's loading.

Them: like what? What how that would work, I think, is important. Mhmm. And and it sounds like it's not just orchestrating the conversation. Effectively across technology tools. It's also, like, some kind of summative feedback moment

Me: For teachers or parents or students or that dashboard.

Them: Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of things on that list.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Of those would be nice. Like, you you have to

Me: Right.

Them: think about, like, what's possible or, like, what makes the most. Sense for what what you're trying to do. So

Me: But it's great. And so

Them: yeah.

Me: mean, if I were pulling something out that summarize a thread here. It feels like you're you're saying one kid, one screen is kinda like like not that. You know, like, one, you know, one screen, multiple kids, or more than one kid, one screen. Like, how do we use this thing together?

Them: Yeah. Because I think one thing that we found I mean, like, one of our our learning objectives in our data science unit was for students to understand that there's different ways to represent data visually that how you choose to represent data's gonna tell a different story. And so CodeApp is such a great tool because students would just kind of drag and drop and then look at it and think about what is What is now? What does this show me? And does this make sense? And I feel like for us where we wanna take it was then kind of, like, comparing different different visualizations kind of side by side. And so the way we do that in our instruction sequence is we had students do a thing, And then in the next next lesson, you know, we had screenshots of data visualizations that we had created. But I feel like in an ideal world, you'd be able to kind of do that real time with the kids. Like, now let's let's let's look at them. Because I I think you actually really need to see the side by side side view. So not just, like, looking at one, but to kinda see, like, how did different people approach the same question. And that having that visual that kids can like, we sometimes we'd print stuff off and let them have that conversation, and that was rich discussion happened there. Having it in the moment where it's like, oh, I just worked on this thing for twenty minutes. And this is what I have. Oh, this and I'm looking at this one. Okay. Like, would be even richer and more interesting, I think, for for folks to be able to get a chance to do

Me: That's really intriguing. So the other layer of the conversation, I feel like we're we're sort of already on to that that some some portion of the high level code app infrastructure thing that we have been talking about in the the last proposal. Seems like it's resonating with this whole notion. Like, if there were a dashboard or if could see what other people were seeing or if I could share my ideas with somebody else or maybe a

Them: Yeah.

Me: teacher had a lesson they could share with. It sounds like there's they're still there there and that

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: idea.

Them: 100%.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. That's definitely very interesting. And I think as we talk more about resubmission, we could think about that, but it may be that there are other opportunities as well. I mean, we're we are trying to think about different ways to bring forward some of the common trends that we're hearing and, you know, it's you're not the only people thinking about collaborating around artifacts on computers, and we have some technologies that might make that possible. So I think there might be something there, and maybe there are people outside of NSF who'd be willing to fund that too. So it might be very interesting. To play that out, especially given that you so how many classrooms that are using the curriculum that you've got right now? What's the status of that? Is it waiting, staying steady, growing? Are you forgotten about it because you're on to seven other things?

Them: Still doing it.

Me: That's something?

Them: So we're still doing it across middle school.

Me: And how many teachers does that mean?

Them: So we had what do we have last year? Nine, eight, I think. Various levels of you know, like, fidelity is a is a is always a tricky thing around here. But, like, yeah. People jumped in and and and

Me: And when they do it, are they doing it in

Them: did did some stuff, which is which is good.

Me: science? Is it across subjects?

Them: Computer science.

Me: Computer science. Okay.

Them: Yeah. We have we have computer science class. Think the one of the things we've thought about and haven't figured out is this is a cool tool. How do we help other folks in other classes know about it? And that they could use it? And I mean, that was a lot of the work. We wanted to do with the DRK 12 proposal was to kind of, like, bring this across the curriculum. Because we actually feel like, you know, the computer science makes sense to have a discrete you know, to study where you're learning specifically about data science, but all the practice and the application, I feel like it's not it's gonna be it's gonna happen outside of computer science.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Think science is most obvious place.

Me: Yeah. It is. And it also isn't once you start to think about it. We've done some really interesting things in middle school social studies, for example. And

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I mean, it takes a minute for the teacher to get over, maybe depending upon the teacher over that

Them: Mhmm.

Me: you know, concern. But if you pair them with somebody, you give them a little bit or you give them an hour. They get it. I mean, they get the relevance. Right? I mean, immigration data and social studies class

Them: Yep.

Me: is, no brainer. Right? And so all of a sudden, you're in really interesting conversations.

Them: Yeah.

Me: With kids and then teachers lean in from there.

Them: Yeah. I think the other place that we've we've talked about where there's a lot of potential is, our high school our high school seniors have a capstone project graduation requirements, like a big summative project.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Where the students do research and as STEM people every year, that's the time of year Sam and I complain about, like, the lack of data literacy. Because we're like, I did a survey. I asked eight people. Here's my graph. It's the prepopulated thing from Google Forms. Like, come on. Kids can do so much more. You know, like yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Me: Right. Right.

Them: We actually think I was like, man, if we could do some of those data science lessons one, to show the tool and two, to think about, like,

Me: Right.

Them: sample size and and all the sort of, like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: basic data literacy kind of stuff, it would be super powerful that high school capstone class. It would make things make way better

Me: Yeah.

Them: Then projects would be way better.

Me: There you go.

Them: And a lot of the teachers are humanities teachers. Which I think is part of why there's a lot of kind of, like, fear of

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the technology.

Me: Right.

Them: Yeah. But there's an opportunity. There well, there is a need that we have identified

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: identified. In that space as well.

Me: That's very interesting.

Them: And your platform the Kodak platform feels like a a a gateway into that space. Like, it's easy enough You just drag the sheet over or you just upload the sheet, and then you just pull the cut, like, that's usable for kind of humanities teacher. You don't have to know r. You don't have to even get into formulas and sheets or Excel. Like, there's a real opportunity there. Our of our struggles is, like, how do we get that in front of people? Because we don't interface that group as as as much or at all. And so we were trying to figure out, like, what that would

Me: Mhmm.

Them: what that would look like. Yeah. I'm fascinated to hear, like, you have a dedicated computer science curriculum That's interesting. Not everybody does. I also you say the word Brenda engineering. Right? Like so maybe there are classes with that title on them, Are you I have all. Yes. Yeah. So you're not required to, like, jam this into biology or something. Yeah. I mean, for Sam like, Sam's job is funded by Salesforce, which is here in the Bay Area, and they also fund the salaries of our middle school computer science teachers. So part of our unique situation is that we have computer science teachers in all of our middle schools. And Because of of that. My funding for my job comes through like, career development, CTE, I used to have a job supporting science teachers, but there's not funding for core science teachers. The way there is for career and technical education. So I work with a very small handful of engineering and computer science teachers. Instead of the hundreds of science teachers who would love to have more support. That's that's just part of the context that we're in. So I think there's been a lot of opportunity for our teachers to innovate And when we think about getting kind of, like, back into the the mainstream, of all the core academic classes. That's why we look for things like

Me: I

Them: grants that can fund that work.

Me: Yeah. I was I was interested in the Salesforce

Them: When the district can't.

Me: connection because I ran into some Salesforce people at the in Anaheim conference a while back. That's been there for a long time, but the CS piece in terms of the teacher funding, it's been a handful years, three, four, five years. Did they fund as well? Or what's the what's the history on that?

Them: It's been about ten years now.

Me: Okay. And always always the same sort of we're gonna fund teacher positions period, or is it vary in terms of what they want?

Them: So we give yeah, we've always had it be they don't wanna buy stuff.

Me: Okay.

Them: They don't wanna buy computers. They don't wanna buy desks. They don't wanna make furniture. They don't wanna make They wanna fund people and professional development. And so that has been it pays my salary. We've paid as much FTE as we can. We get the amount, and then we figure out how much FTE we can offer to the school. The school pays the other part We pay for professional development. We haven't we've never purchased curriculum It just says that has been free, we felt like for a long time that was the best one out there. We couldn't see a reason to

Me: Alright.

Them: to pay money for the other option.

Me: And they were involved in saying we wanna build this new curriculum. We're gonna pay for

Them: So I think

Me: or something for that. They were we've we've got this other opportunity to teach it. We've

Them: Yeah.

Me: got they're paying for the people to teach it. Mhmm.

Them: Yes. No. They did they weren't they were not it it was never a we're gonna build we're gonna build a curriculum, we're gonna build a a or any of that. It was it was it was how do we get kids learning computer science?

Me: You have consistent PD still. How much how much time does that take up, how much time is supported and what times of the year?

Them: We we offer a summer some summer PD every summer. We offer PD the second Wednesday of each month. We've been doing that in both of those re more recently have been in, with with with other STEM teachers. So science teachers have been a part of that. Some of our other CTE teachers, health teachers have been a part of that. We have a couple times a year where we have dedicated computer science release days. So we pull people out and and get more into, like, the computer science part. The STEM PDs have been more focused on pedagogy, like, how to get kids talking to each other. What are the language routines that that would would help with conversation?

Me: Do you all do you both design those? Is that all internal? Do you bring any external

Them: Kind of kind of stuff. Mhmm. Yeah.

Me: in for PD? It's it's people's time and and internal.

Them: It's us mostly.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. Everyone wants to know we've the other thing we've done, like, when we do something like the data science thing, where we developed a curriculum, where we developed something, we're we're doing an AI unit Like, we've used WestEd as a as a partner and had Yvonne just be, like, in thought partnership with us. And also to help evaluate how it's going.

Me: That's really useful. This is great. What what did we not ask that we should have

Them: I mean, I think it kinda depends on where you're going. Like, like, what you know, like, don't know what your what you're getting to. It feels like

Me: not we're not totally sure either. We're really just trying to understand.

Them: yeah. You know, like, you know our pain points, you kinda know what what we're what the things that we're excited by, and then in the next is, like, so I don't know if there was anything that stood out to me. I don't know about for you, Brenda. I think one thing is if you get noodling along with something and you're like, what about this? You know? Feel free to give a call, and we could say, like, oh, okay. Like, we could run that past some teachers, or we could give our 2¢ for whatever that's worth on the thing as you'd as

Me: Yeah.

Them: if you got farther down the road.

Me: Mhmm. Is there anybody else we should be talking to? Inside the district, outside the district, in some other states?

Them: I mean, think if you have like, if you if you wanna get more in\-depth about, like, integration with Clever or other, you know, like, can connect you with a guy. You know, when he does that. If you wanna talk more about, you know, high school science curriculum, we can

Me: Sir,

Them: connect you with that for like, it kinda depend.

Me: Yep. That that that's great. Yeah. I don't I don't have a specific ask there. Just sort of wondering.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So in terms of open loops here, I think, you know, one one is a, this is really useful, and, you know, it may seem like everyday stuff for you, but that's what actually we're interested in now is getting that picture b, I think we've opened up some really some interesting things that might have resonance with ideas that we've been ginning up. And so we may wanna come back and ask about those, or maybe there's some you know, opportunity to fund something together independently with a, you know, foundation or who what would be happy to to come back with if we get a glimpse of that. And I think C and there are probably a D and an E, I'm forgetting. But I think you're onto something, Brenda, when you're saying, like, how could we deal with the caps courses or you're mentioning this and get this in front of them. Just earlier this week, was talking to another PI and she has an actually pretty nice, you know, interdisciplinary CS curriculum that uses code app too or so that might be interesting. But she would we were saying, like, what about, like, data Fridays? Or something like that? Like, is there some way of having to, like, forty five minute thing that I could just pull down and use because god knows Fridays are Fridays. But that might be just enough because it doesn't take much. Right? I mean, of get that whiff of credit and be like, oh, wait. I could do this. I mean and but it's getting it in front of them. I think you're right.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I I think the other thing for that piece especially if we're thinking about humanities teachers, is what is data Fridays, but they're gonna need some support

Me: Exactly. So what do I use? What do I do? How do I start it?

Them: in like, how how to get that off the ground? Like, like, what does it look like? What are some what are some conversations to

Me: Total? Mhmm.

Them: have? But and I think the the other thing that might be interesting in that is you guys have some of the datasets, like the when I go to code app, there's the roller coaster one. There's some the ones that exist in there. I don't know if there's a bigger library or, you know, like,

Me: No. Mean, there yeah. So I think there are two things. So, yes, there we're starting to think about that, and we're

Them: I was a humanities teacher,

Me: always a pain point. And hidden inside the plug ins menu are data choosers. You can get all of the American Community Survey data. You can

Them: Yeah.

Me: get subsets of that with just a push of a button. So there are really interesting questions you can ask with those for humanities sometimes to census data and things like that. So

Them: Yeah. So, like, how to mess with that and then the other thing about data sets is, like, are they clean enough? Are they are they

Me: Yeah.

Them: so overwhelming? And, like, what does that look like? So but that's a that's a space that I think is interesting for humanities teacher to try and

Me: Exactly. Yeah.

Them: to they're gonna noodle around, oh, okay. Cool. We can get into this. I'm curious. Are either of you participating in the code app v three beta program?

Me: Oh, you should.

Them: I don't know about it. So no.

Me: Very good point, Leslie.

Them: Yeah.

Me: We will

Them: Like,

Me: we will

Them: Like

Me: let you know. Yeah. We're we're probably bring that third version and trying to get feedback and, you know, from and and non expert users alike. So we will we will pull you in, if you're interested. Great.

Them: Nice.

Me: Thank you so much for taking time out of what is a crazy day and a crazy week and a crazy beginning of the year. We feel really appreciate it, and I'm sure I'll see you more with people at WestEd as we talk about proposals. But we'll we will ring you when we've got more things to to to offer to.

Them: Alright. Thanks.

Me: Wonderful. Great to see you again.

Them: Yep. You too.

Me: Have a good have a good week. Bye.

Them: Bye.
