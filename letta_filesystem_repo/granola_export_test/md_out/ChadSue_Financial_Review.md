\#\#\# Financial Board Update

\- Will PDF the financial report and send to Board as part of tonight’s check\-in

\- Will mention we received grants from Cisco and two others

\- Noted layoffs still happening, but additional funding might minimize FTE reductions

\- Haven’t tapped into the $500,000 Valhalla development fund yet

\- Conserving Valhalla funds for development director salary and business development efforts

\- Nearly $1,000 in donations received

\- Will use tonight’s meeting to gather questions for the August 22 call

\- By August 22 should have both development director and business development direction in place

\#\#\# Budget Review

\- New segmented budget\-to\-actuals report implemented to track different funding sources

\- Blue columns (federal funds) always carry 33\.28% overhead

\- Contracts should have minimum 33\.28% overhead, ideally with surplus

\- Non\-federal grants may have variable overhead rates

\- Current financial status:

\- 75% through fiscal year with revenue at expected levels (71% NSF, 77% Dept of Ed)

\- Subawards running slightly low, contracts have unusual pattern due to NAM

\- DSR/Valhalla money ($900K) spending increased significantly last month

\- Currently have $43,000 surplus in overhead

\- Need to close out Code App v3 (\\\~$20,000 remaining) \- Sue will ask Leslie to handle

\- Unrestricted revenue at 5,100% of budget target

\#\#\# Development Director Planning

\- Development Director position would be classified as overhead, not direct

\- For $150K salary, total annual cost would be approximately $225K (1\.5x multiplier)

\- Valhalla funds could support position for two years if necessary

\- Need to start spending Valhalla funds soon for reporting purposes

\- If hiring September 1, will have four months of salary to report by year end

\- If overhead funds become sufficient, could consider hiring F\&A person with overlap before Judy leaves

\- Sue will spend money on MIP consultant to improve financial reporting processes

\- Considering presenting a simplified version of financial report at August board meeting

Transcript:

Them: Hi.

Me: Why? Alright.

Them: I could see you more today than

Me: I know. Sorry. My apology.

Them: ever.

Me: But

Them: No. Fine by me. Oh, we can I think we can make this short shorter? Because it seems like there's a development director thing that we need to get back to, and I would like

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: understand. Board stuff if you've had a chance to look at my board

Me: Right. And so I probably haven't. But I should. Let me

Them: Oh, I see. I sent that this morning. Actually, let's look at that first if you

Me: Yes. Definitely. Is that Slack?

Them: yeah, Slacked.

Me: Probably? Okay. Cool. I'm up there.

Them: I can drop the link in.

Me: I'll find it just I love other Slack things. Alright. Yeah. There we go. Good. Okay. Oh, I guess we were awarded. I didn't think about that as an award. Anyway, I guess it it wasn't an award in the last month, but we've finalized it in the last month. Of the DD one. Is that right?

Them: Yeah. We got the

Me: Okay.

Them: contract from Berkeley and the yes.

Me: Alright. So my if effectively awarded

Them: Unless you've told them.

Me: oh, whatever. It

Them: Mhmm.

Me: retelling them is not a problem. Okay. Yep. That's good. Yeah. I think that information is fine, and maybe the the question they want together is, like, what's the best way to present that as opposed to sending it or walking through? I mean, like, what's the what's the best way to put put that information in front of them in a brief version tonight? I'm making like three slides on my side and was thinking that through myself as well.

Them: I I I actually wouldn't mind having it

Me: That's fine. Mhmm.

Them: sent to them so they have it. And, I mean, maybe the executive summary it doesn't have anything to do with the financials, but say that, you know, we we did get three grants, you know, Cisco and the two others. We do we are in negotiation or whatever for a few more and that this you know, the top part, know, this won't stop the layoffs, but it might minimize any FTE reductions that we need to to do. But we won't know this until closer to the end of the fall. And right now, have not yet had to tap into that 500,000 for the Valhalla development, but we are

Me: Mhmm.

Them: conserving it for our development director's salary and business development efforts. And

Me: Yeah. I think that's fine. And and I may just send it as a financial update and say there's more coming during the meeting anyway because you know, good to have the check\-in meetings. We don't necessarily have much to say. Not that I'm expecting trying to swim to fill an hour either, but got plenty of time to you know, describe things to them during the call as well. So

Them: Mhmm.

Me: either way. But

Them: Is it

Me: but, yeah, No. I don't think

Them: do you think there's other data I should have prepared?

Me: so. I don't think it's is there stuff they're gonna ask for? Is there a thing? Probably not. And, you know, anything that people ask for that we don't have, we can say this is good. We're gathering questions about what we should make sure we show everybody in the August 22 call because we're gonna talk

Them: Mhmm.

Me: to them again in three weeks anyway. So I don't I don't think that there's a whole lot more we need to to worry about really. This is

Them: Yeah.

Me: yeah, just bringing people up to speed before we are.

Them: I think I think by that time, well, August 22, we'll have a development director. Hopefully, we'll have a business development direction and not specific direction, but people that are helping us get a direction. Right? And

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I think

Them: yeah, Okay.

Me: so. So I think that's all fine.

Them: And we made almost a thousand dollars in

Me: Yes. Exactly. Yeah. That they're all good.

Them: donations. So we keep that up every week. We're in good shape.

Me: Word set. Exactly. Yeah. No. I think that's just fine. So I'm happy to to send that along and say more coming, and I can use it as a chance remind people that we're

Them: Okay.

Me: you know, have a check\-in tonight. So come on by if you're didn't remember remember.

Them: Sounds good. Alright. So I will

Me: I Okay.

Them: just leave it like that, and you'll whatever you need to do with it

Me: Think it's good. I will I'll p d I'll PDF it and send it off to people and as a reminder. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. Sounds great.

Me: Okay.

Them: Alright. So I dropped in the chat. The first note is the that segmented budget to actuals.

Me: Right.

Them: Which I think is actually gonna be I I'm hoping it's gonna be really useful for you and I to talk about things as they roll forward. So

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: you could probably figure out that column c, f,

Me: Yep.

Them: I, l, these are all the budgets that put together at the beginning of the fiscal year. And then columns d, g, j, blah blah blah, are, where we are as of June 3,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: '30\. So we're and then they're in row 27\. Talks about, you know, where we are with actual revenue based on what we had projected for the year. So we're about 75% of the way through the fiscal year, and we're

Me: Right.

Them: you know, 71% revenue for NSF, 77% for Department of Ed. Like, we're in the ballpark Subawards a little bit low. Don't know why. The the yeah, the contracts.

Me: Right.

Them: Contracts are just odd because we've got NAM in there right now, and then so I'm not sure how much will be spent on that. And then we did start spending in a big way, the DSR money last month. Which kind of surprised me how much we spent. I would love to

Me: That's the other Valhalla one, you mean?

Them: the the Valhalla one. Yeah. The 900 k.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: I would love to finish up the code app v three before we

Me: Oh, have we not closed that? I thought we had.

Them: mm\-mm.

Me: Maybe that was why we transitioned.

Them: There there was, like,

Me: Because

Them: 20,000\. It's not a huge amount, but it would be nice to just

Me: yeah. Definitely. I thought I thought that we I was transitioning people

Them: clean up blood and then move on. Okay.

Me: I thought that we had already you know, we're on a track to closing that off and didn't wanna over overcharge that line.

Them: Alright. I'll I'll ask.

Me: So, yeah, if you if you let

Them: Leslie to

Me: him yeah. Leslie especially and probably don't need to worry about Zach and Kate. They're probably already transitioned across, but but however we wanna do that,

Them: Yeah. It's it's only sticky money at this point.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. No. That's perfectly fine. Let let let let you know, and she'll be happy to to soak that up.

Them: For Okay. Okay. Yeah. No doubt.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So the idea with this, the reason why Carol wanted us to start using this is because there's, the federal stuff, the stuff in blue is always gonna have our

Me: Right.

Them: 33\.28% whatever on it. The contracts, would be always nice to have at the minimum 33\.28, at the very minimum. But then always have a surplus in here that

Me: Right.

Them: you should turn around and say, Sue, where's our surplus? On the contract? And and for the nonfederal grants budgets, this is now 33\.28, but it might not always be 33\.28\. So we need to make sure that we have an unrestricted revenue

Me: Right.

Them: budget that could help supplement that

Me: So there's a big big red square down on the bottom that says actual, you know, actual ICR and word sort of you know, very radar pop up pop homing in on 33\. Yeah. Okay. Mhmm.

Them: Yep. Exactly. Yeah. Actually, I should put that in there now that you mention it. What we do have is a big yellow square

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: and well, the brain tegdale, columns u through y that's says we now have a surplus of about $43,000 in

Me: Okay.

Them: overhead. So that's

Me: That comes from the

Them: good.

Me: surplus in column o kind of thing, or what's the or or that's just normal overhead surplus.

Them: Because we're we're underspending on the

Me: Okay. Okay. Great.

Them: overhead right now. I think

Me: Okay. Yeah.

Them: I you know, I think we probably could have squeezed in the Hannah hire, but it's

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: just it was whatever. It is what it is. So

Me: Yep.

Them: I think it gives us some sense of

Me: That's good.

Them: what we might be able to do next. I don't know.

Me: Uh\-huh. Yep.

Them: I don't know what it means.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. No. That's okay.

Them: But it means we're not, like, sweating bullets right now.

Me: Right. So that is the red line I was describing, but and that is pulling from

Them: Yeah.

Me: all of these columns right now. So when that becomes negative, you know, we need some, like, that plus our, you know, what is it, the Rho 11, you know, that basically is the real question or something like that. Right? Essentially, how do we do we make that zero or positive every year And when it's positive, how do we know that it's not positive because of the blue columns or something like that?

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Exactly. That's exactly it. Yes.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Couldn't have said it better myself.

Me: Great. Well, if I can remember what I said, that's even even better. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. And and I I like that 51 of a 100%. If we can keep

Them: In that frankly, yeah,

Me: that up, we should show that to the development director.

Them: Yeah.

Me: The 5000% unrestricted number is is really good.

Them: I said right.

Me: Keep that year year on year. I think if we can keep close to that, then we'll be really doing great.

Them: I think we should explain to her that that's the baseline that we're used to.

Me: Alright. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: Yeah. I you know, this year, this year, we if you saw this report and this y cell y two six had a negative of a 120,000\. That just means we've spent down a 120,000 of that Valhalla money. So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: at some point, there might be a better way to visualize that. But

Me: Oh, I see. So that's the the hidden the hidden thing in there is because we haven't haven't eaten into any of our unaccounted or an overhead accounted for things. So that

Them: Right.

Me: number seems useful, but it might not be after a while.

Them: Yeah. Right. Right. I mean, maybe at some point, have to spend the Valhalla money

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: So maybe it's bad that we haven't spent it yet, but I but, you know, the fact that we've been able everything that we've done so far is allowable under overhead.

Me: Right.

Them: And so there's no reason to have dipped into a special fund We will start having that you know, one zero seven prod that fundraising project, so there will be more and more charges that are unallowable.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But I'm hoping at minimum that they can be covered by the donations that we get in at least.

Me: How do we plan to I mean, if we spent down that that whole 500 k this year in the in in the Valhalla funds in this spreadsheet, the way it is right now, we would have a that number would show a massive overhead problem. Because we're not accounting for that as overhead money as well. Is that right? So, like, how do we how do we deal with spending unrestricted funds and not make it seem like we're in an overhead hole Is that the right question to ask? I mean, the 500 k I was hearing you to say that

Them: Yeah.

Me: 500 k is, like, all direct. Right? Well, it's not really. It's could be all balanced or what have you, but the question is, so in the end, when they do the audit, they're gonna count that as direct funds unless we think of it otherwise. Or something.

Them: No. They count they count it as an unrestricted

Me: Okay.

Them: overhead. So they'll so our overhead once we do start spending it down, our overhead rate could go from 33% to 60% because we don't have the direct we have a lot of overhead money to spend and not a lot of direct money supporting it. And so but that's not

Me: Oh. Mhmm. But Right.

Them: bad. Mean, we can always tell

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: you know, the feds, we're not gonna charge you sixty three.

Me: I'm not charging you 60%. Uh\-huh.

Them: Or or we'd like to have a 60% rate, but we won't actually use it. Or

Me: Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: I mean, I don't I don't think the feds won't entertain anything close to that. And and we can explain to them we got this unrestricted money. We've we're using it on x This is why our overhead rate is higher in this proposal. And know, it won't stay this way forever or something like that.

Me: Mhmm. And so and that's because we're spending it, the unrestricted as direct and not charging the overhead against it. Is that right? Or, you know,

Them: No.

Me: or other way around?

Them: We're spending the unrestricted as overhead.

Me: I see. Okay. And we are doing that because we are assigning the dollars from that to something that would normally be called overhead if it were charged another way. In other words, if we didn't have if we'd spent it on project staff, that would be different, or is it inherently because it's unrestricted? Right.

Them: Well, so we what we want to do is add a position, an overhead position,

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: to Concord staff, and we we don't want to classify the development director as a direct

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: person. So we we need to get everyone used to the fact that

Me: Totally.

Them: this is an overhead position that just happens to be funded by something different. And so if we

Me: Right.

Them: so we set a precedent for it, there's no reason not to

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: It's an allowable overhead charge. And

Me: So so it's right. And I'm just clarifying that the situation we're talking about right now is a is a classification issue, not an unrestricted funds issue or something like we might you might imagine another world where we got 500 k unrestricted funds, and we bought a supercomputer with it. And or we paid for direct staff with it or something like that. In that case, then we

Them: Yeah.

Me: end up with a deficit in overhead funds because we use it all for direct and we didn't account for

Them: Yeah. Well,

Me: in overhead in some other way. It's just the way we're happening to use it right now. We probably would've all rebalanced it in that way.

Them: right. I I would not let that happen, but, yeah, that's right.

Me: Exactly. Yeah. Right. So in a normal so a normal use of unrestricted funds would we would balance this more. So

Them: Yeah. If we just

Me: that we'd make sure that we're drawing in 33% ratio normally.

Them: Right. If you said, I wanted to take that 500,000, I wanna build a suite of online programs that will make us money in the future. Then you would get, you know,

Me: You said you're 24\. Yeah. Go for it. Right?

Them: $350,000 in direct and a 150 in overhead, and I would let you do the thing, and then we'd make a lot of money. So

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Good.

Them: yeah,

Me: That's useful just to make sure. I mean, not used to unrestricted funds, so that's all that tells me. Okay. Good.

Them: And so but that

Me: Right.

Them: is all to say, like, if you wanna do something, like that, you know, we should know sooner rather than later.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So that we can allocate it accordingly.

Me: Yeah. No. It's all fun.

Them: Yep. Yeah. I mean, other other than that, you know, the benefits rate is up a little bit higher than we would want, but part of that's because of the severance that we've paid out, and it's just gonna be that way for a little while.

Me: Yep.

Them: Tech pull is a little bit higher. Occupancy is the same. But we're, you know, we're in that 50% area.

Me: On that development director piece, So let's say we, you know, settle on

Them: Mhmm.

Me: a little bit more, like $1\.50 as a salary here for a round number. How much you so what is that actually out of that unrestricted bubble and know, how much do we have left or how long is that carry us or whatever, you know, because yeah, we don't draw overhead on it. So it's not $1\.50 plus something, but there's also a balance benefits and whatever. So don't know when that when that clears at the end of a year or how much have we had to lay out exactly a 150 more than a 150 all from that?

Them: No. It would be, like,

Me: Or is it 300? Because it's 2\.2 times two yeah.

Them: $202\.25\. Yeah.

Me: Okay.

Them: Two point yeah. One you're gonna multiply it by 1\.5\.

Me: Okay. Right. So it's we if it were direct, we'd multiply it by more because of what we're just talking about because overhead

Them: A two. Yeah.

Me: we'll apply it. So so it really is if we think of it as solely development director, it's pretty much two straight years of that salary if you wanna use it that way.

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: Okay. That's useful to know.

Them: Yeah. I mean, yes. And

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Of course.

Them: 'd want them to raise their own salary within a short amount of time. Yeah.

Me: Just sort of just trying to I've been been doing that calculus in my head saying, alright. Is it's $1\.50 and they're raising something, does that really mean that we're gonna have a problem of having, you know, again, not that we're required to use it over two years either, but we're balancing. I don't know. But, you know, if know, if we're only drawing a 100 of it in a year and we've got 500, we have 300 left over at the end of two years that we're not using early enough or taking an accounting for or what have you You know? Sounds like probably don't have that problem, but probably we'll have a little bed at least, and we should know seven months into a year in whether we have an extra half year of salary in that or we wanna reapportion of that money or what have you. Mhmm. Mhmm. Right.

Them: Yeah. Well, we'll have to certainly report to them I don't remember when we have to report to them, but definitely by the calendar year, end. And I don't think we wanna report that we haven't spent anything. So

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. No. I agree.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And okay, that's very useful.

Them: Figuring out yeah, figuring out what we want to say or, you know, checking in on October 1 Yeah. We I mean,

Me: Yeah. I I mean, if we're if we were hiring somebody

Them: could get him.

Me: September 1, we've got four months of salary that we're charging to that, which is, you know, I think entirely fine and defensible.

Them: Yeah. Unless we have you know, unless we're already generating enough overhead money to cover

Me: That's great.

Them: their salary, in which case we should should really think about hiring an f and a person

Me: Celebrate. We're learning something else. Yeah.

Them: Yeah. And then having some overlap with Judy before she leaves, so which we we should probably do anyway.

Me: Right. Right.

Them: But I think this all speaks to the fact that we've got a little bit of elbow room right now.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah. No. That's good. As long as things continue to chug, mean, the one thing that I get nervous about is August 1 and I'm still not hearing anything about these letters. And I have no idea if that just means that they're happening from NSF slowly but surely, or there's a giant bunch of things that people have been on vacation and haven't dealt with or if somebody is just running out the clock, you know, or what have you. Right? So that's that's the one thing I

Them: Yeah.

Me: know right now. Mhmm.

Them: And we haven't heard anything about the indirect cost rate negotiation.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Which I don't think they would

Me: Right.

Them: get rid of our rate without then a whole another lawsuit, but they're gonna make it a pain in the ass

Me: Right. Right. Right.

Them: if they start negotiating a rate that we closed out you know, a year and a half ago on. So

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Interesting.

Them: there's all sorts of ways they could still torture us.

Me: That's certainly true. Yes. Okay. Good. I agree. This is useful. I think it's nice to be thinking of it that way. I think if we're

Them: Okay.

Me: know, combining this I mean, the the grand plan our squinting pieces, combining this with the big proposal, quote unquote, database with projections or something. Like, I can I can imagine in my mind's eye making that all happen? You know, without as much difficulty as it feels like it should take, but it's not as simple as in my mind's eye either.

Them: I I would I'm I am going to spend money on the MIP consultant because I know that there's an easier way to at least

Me: Mhmm.

Them: do this than I'm doing it now from MIP.

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: So the you know, little baby step

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: there. But I also think this would be useful for the new

Me: Definitely.

Them: development director as they come on so they can understand how we

Me: Yeah.

Them: operate in these different realms.

Me: Yeah. I think that's great.

Them: Alright.

Me: Excellent. I think that's really good. And I don't think this is something that showed tonight, I will mail that other thing. I do wonder whether some version of this with only two rows or something, you know, would be really would be useful in August for the board. I mean, it feels like there's a this kinda tells a story of how we're thinking through funding differently that might speak to itself on the page pretty easily for somebody. We should test that in eight different ways before we put it out from people and find out that they're blown away by the numbers. Maybe it's just that columns, column titles that matters. But but it's interesting. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I think okay. Well, that's good. Good to hear. Good to know. You know, the more

Me: Right.

Them: information you give them, the more people are gonna say, how come there is no surplus under your contract?

Me: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's, like,

Them: But but whatever. You know? So there isn't right now.

Me: not saying that to careful you ask for kind of thing. So definitely we should think more about

Them: Right.

Me: maybe it's something to run by finance ish folks.

Them: Yeah. I think that the I think that this would be great to share more widely so people

Me: Yep.

Them: can get their heads around what is or at least I it helps me get my head around what actually is happening and

Me: Right. I think so.

Them: conquered. I did, present it to Lisa too so she could start thinking

Me: That's good.

Them: more this way. Yeah.

Me: Alright. Excellent.

Them: K.

Me: Great. Well, I will send that other people off to the board. I will think about questions I don't know. People probably haven't chewed on that Google Doc in the last hour or two, but I think Rick may dump some stuff in there.

Them: Oh, yeah. Rick Rick's already dumped some stuff in.

Me: Okay. That's great. Yeah. So we'll

Them: And then Ron talked about asked if, we wanna get together fifteen minutes before, which I think is

Me: Sure. Totally fine. That's a good idea as well. We'll have it it'll be a little bit awkward with somebody in person, so maybe

Them: probably a good idea.

Me: twenty minutes before or something. But but yeah.

Them: Do you want me to try to connect with do you we do that? Or I can just invite people

Me: I think we just invite people to a separate

Them: Yeah.

Me: thing fifteen minutes before or something or whatever or use the same number and just add a add a second invite on. Just that'll probably be easiest thing. Same the same Zoom

Them: Use the same number.

Me: number. Not that it matters. It's only Ron. Well, I guess it's Ron and Rick. There's there should be a Zoom connection in the original invite.

Them: Oh, oh, okay.

Me: And I would just copy that Zoom connection so that people don't get on the a weird one and get confused. Mhmm.

Them: Yep. Yep. Okay. That makes sense. Why don't I go do that now?

Me: Okay. That's good. Alright. Very good.

Them: Alright. Good.

Me: Thanks. Bye.

Them: Thanks, Chad. Yeah. Bye.
