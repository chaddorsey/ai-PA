Transcript:

Them: Hello.

Me: Hello.

Them: Welcome back after vacation.

Me: Yes. Thank you. I'm slowly rebooting.

Them: I do have a lot of things on this list. If you wanna scan down

Me: I'm looking just a second here. Because oops. K. There. There. I'm logged back in there. And Weird. Okay. Anyway, see all right Nice. Yeah. That's a good collection of stuff.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Well done.

Them: Okay. It's a lot. Yeah. No. All of sudden, it just started growing.

Me: Yeah. That's fine. So, yeah, let me answer a couple I mean, I

Them: So they

Me: can answer piecemeal on a couple things, and then we can dig in on everything else. So I've uploaded everything for the report. I've uploaded Rachel and Ray's thing this morning. I

Them: Yep.

Me: still keep on I've been reloading all morning to try to get it to show up from the par.

Them: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It can

Me: Have them So yeah.

Them: can take a day or two, so don't worry about that.

Me: Exactly. So that's all ready to go as soon as that shows up. And

Them: And you had some from Joe and Trang.

Me: yes, those are all had deal so it was much easier. So those were those have all been in.

Them: Okay. Great.

Me: And I think all the I haven't checked the whether we need anything for CMPs, I think the people are all fine and in there. So I

Them: The same page should it's just you and Joe.

Me: yeah. Yep. So I think everything is fine except for that

Them: Okay.

Me: PAR record, and I'll double check that. So, yeah, that's that's still on my list, and it's literally it's on my list as well. So I'll I'll get that as soon as that uploads.

Them: Okay. Super. The question about archiving the project page is a so on concord.org, on a research projects, it's really

Me: Right. Right. Yep.

Them: literally just flip a switch. It'll take

Me: Sure.

Them: twenty you know, ten second

Me: Yep.

Them: The the question is, if you if you go there right now, you'll see 21 active projects.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: But I think that I would if I were being honest, if we were, you know, ones that are really aren't funded right now,

Me: Right.

Them: we would be getting rid of

Me: Mhmm.

Them: half a dozen or something like that. I mean, Ilk Ilkmar is still up there because we had that banner.

Me: Right. Right.

Them: But not just that, you know, has ended and so have a number of has ended and so have a numb

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: things here.

Me: It's a messaging thing. Right? Because they don't show up

Them: Guess my question is just a little bit of kind of, like, Exactly. It's a messaging thing.

Me: right now. Yeah. And people don't care outside necessarily.

Them: Exactly. It's a messaging

Me: Yep.

Them: And if we only have 15 or 12 or 13 of

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: and part of that is that people are you know,

Me: Alright.

Them: Sorry. Without name calling, people don't always write their project

Me: Exactly.

Them: Write write the project page. So for instance, I've asked Jay about 42 times.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: To write one for a neural net maker. Now and I and data data goat, there was sort of like, oh, is that gonna get funded? Is that gonna get pulled? Are we gonna get the money for a subaward?

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: So there have been legitimate questions, and then there have just been usuals. Usual delays. So so it is a messaging question, and I just wanted to sort of put it out there. That we really should be flipping the switch, or at least it's been our policy or practice of doing that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But I am mindful of the fact that right now,

Me: Right.

Them: gonna start just like our staff numbers. Like, it's gonna start looking very slim.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: So we don't have to have, like,

Me: Yeah.

Them: or no on data, could be all fine, but it's a bigger question.

Me: Uh\-huh. Yeah. I think that's a good question. I think, you know, being a little bit light on the pedal

Them: Yeah.

Me: in terms of flipping things over is fine. I mean, I think it goes to the messaging piece too, the way things are set up. I mean, people don't care. It's not like it's you know, we're gonna be slapped for it by a chef or art or anything like that.

Them: Right.

Me: It's more I mean, really, the question is what do we want people to see when they come to our website. And so that goes in with the bigger question of

Them: Right. Yeah.

Me: like, what are we showing off? And if hiding things

Them: Yeah.

Me: just because of our own policy switches or whatever, then it's kinda silly. So

Them: Right.

Me: so we should we should think about that together with this. And, yeah, so I would tend to wait for the moment, but Mhmm. Totally about yeah.

Them: So I will not I am gonna wait

Me: Yeah.

Them: I wanted to have this sort of at some point, we should have that larger question. It's

Me: Totally about. Right.

Them: kinda like, holy crap. That would mean we we're doing our whole website. But I don't wanna

Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. I'm with you. I I I I go there. Yep. Yep.

Them: so, like, right there. Okay.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: So the big thing that's next is email the subscribers.

Me: Yep. Okay.

Them: There's a link there. You and Ron should read this. You don't need to do this right now.

Me: Yep.

Them: Time. But what I want to ask about is timing. So Rick Kylie, and I have weekly Thursday meetings. Kylie was on vacation on Thursday, so it was just me and Rick.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Rick and I have very different opinions about when this should go out. Rick wants us to go out yesterday. Like, he wants us go out

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: literally as soon as possible.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I, on the other hand, want to wait until Danielle's on board. I think that in our when you when you and I met in person in Concord, a couple weeks ago, it was Rick had literally just sent his first draft. And I remember saying to you, I had literally

Me: Right.

Them: thirty minutes before or something, but my first impression was I didn't like it It was too long, and it had this sort of vague, like, we're, you know, we're gonna be hiring a new director of development, yada yada. I edited it and sent it to Rick, and he liked my version, but he's still not enough for going out. He said that that would have been that's it was almost like he didn't use the word aggressive, but more it was too bold as a first So he wanted this longer email with the whole context and whatever. So I went back to his, and I edited it again.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: But this time, meanwhile, we hired Danielle. And so what I really like is you know, anytime it feels to me like when there's an ask ask, like, from any corporation any nonprofit, whatever, You have this lovely profile of this adorable person who's the head of giving or the whatever whatever. Right? And you see her cute little picture and you read her cute little profile. I think that for me feels so much better than We've hired a director of development. So I want to be able to name Danielle so we can for me and not only that, I want

Me: Mhmm.

Them: an to go to her staff page with a pretty picture of Danielle.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because I just feel like that is so much more real, and it feels good, and she's beautiful, and blah blah. Like, all of the sort of things that make you know, it it just makes it real. And that would mean waiting to send this until September '5,

Me: Right.

Them: And Rick says, no. He wants it out ASAP. And I said, I'm not the boss.

Me: But Right.

Them: But I vote for waiting until Danielle's on board because we can't name her. I'm not comfortable naming her

Me: Yeah.

Them: till she's actually on staff.

Me: Mhmm. Okay. Alright. So, yeah, I think

Them: This would have to go back to some vague ridiculous thing.

Me: I I get it totally. I've heard, you know, him mention that I haven't gone through the rationale with him necessarily. I'll look to see, you know, meetings maybe a little bit you know, unusual timing because Sue is gone this week, so we didn't

Them: Right.

Me: have one today. But I will I can check\-in with him regardless.

Them: My I said, there for me, I feel like two and a half weeks right now like, it's the difference between it's not gonna go out today. Right?

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah. So it's

Them: Of course. And if

Me: starts to become a it's irrelevant difference before too long. Right?

Them: it's a bit

Me: Yeah.

Them: Exactly. Literally. Because this is gonna be you and Ron both need to read it.

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: That's Rick's recommendation is that you and Ron read it.

Me: Yep.

Them: Whether or not it's just you and you want Ron or not, that's your

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But anyway, you have to read it. Then it has to be formatted in Mailchimp.

Me: Yep.

Them: Which is not ten minutes. We if it is a Mailchimp thing, we still have we'd have to decide if it there's an image at the

Me: Yep.

Them: top. Right now, there isn't. So, like, there's still kinda, like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: pieces. I would say to you, I would say to Rick I did say to Rick, the four minute difference, you know, the four day difference between sending it out now and after the September 2, you're not gonna miss some high net worth individual. They're still gonna have money.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Like, you know, if there's somebody on our mailing list that

Me: Right.

Them: like, gave away all their money at the August,

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so

Them: You know?

Me: I think that's true. And I think everything else that you said is true. And, you know, they they don't imply the same thing, which is to say, we don't have to wait until Danielle is onboard to do the other pieces.

Them: Great.

Me: Whatever. So, I mean, my let's review it. Let's format it. Let's do it. Let let's bat around if we're Danielle or not Danielle, picture or whatever, and let's get that all sorted out regardless. And then, you know, we can you

Them: Well, sure.

Me: we need to do that no matter what. I mean, if there's if there are blockers because of, you know,

Them: No.

Me: want Danielle to check on it or whatever,

Them: And

Me: that's fine. But we can do 70% of it before that. Mhmm.

Them: right, we could also have Danielle herself read it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You're like, you know, day one, she's here for one hour. Here's your first task is

Me: Mhmm.

Them: to read this. It's gonna be going out in within the next ten minutes. I also asked typically, when somebody joins staff, I write to them within the first few days and said, hi. Well,

Me: Right.

Them: Can you write your staff bio? Tell me what your favorite ice cream flavor is, and we'll have figure out a photograph

Me: Mhmm.

Them: for you. So I asked Judy and Sue last week what they thought about being in touch with Danielle sooner rather than later about the bio and the photo. Judy said that she would put it on her list to ask Danielle soon about a writing bio. She didn't say specifically about photo, but Chad this cute thing I just found I found earlier I found last week. I just put it in the Zoom chat.

Me: Mhmm. Oh, nice.

Them: When I was

Me: Mhmm.

Them: when I was thinking about our friend Jesse who took all these pictures, she wrote this lovely

Me: Oh, cool. That's great.

Them: story about us. Now it's kind of like, okay. She didn't actually ask permission. I don't think.

Me: Yeah. Well, that's okay. We have I mean, she we signed it. So

Them: To you So but there's this great kind of, like, I love that she talks about how Concord these these kind of products are great reminder that professional photography doesn't have to stiff. It can be joyful, smart, and tailored to your brand's mission and energy.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Like, clearly, there's nice things to say about Concord. Anyway, I don't know if Jesse Jesse, I think her career has taken off since we found her. Which is very exciting for her. She's a young person. I don't know that we'll find that we'll get Jesse, but

Me: Yep.

Them: I think like, we need to in that stock.

Me: Right.

Them: As soon as possible for Danielle. Because I do

Me: Yeah.

Them: if this is in my head, it all makes sense to have a staff profile with a great picture of Danielle because I think that you know, the LinkedIn connections, the people who know her, whatever, whatever.

Me: Yeah. Well, so so let's kick that to the the onboarding meeting even if that's just you and me and Judy because we can

Them: Okay.

Me: we can hash out any of those questions there as well. And I agree.

Them: Sure.

Me: You know, I can I I wrote down and check\-in with Rick and look at the the messaging? And if you roll forward, on, you know, even if it's version one, version two, or whatever on getting it all

Them: Yep.

Me: ready, then we can easily decide how to move that forward.

Them: I can do that.

Me: Because I agree that worse at the very least, we wanna send it out as soon as she gets here.

Them: Right.

Me: We don't wanna we don't wanna be delayed on that.

Them: I can do that.

Me: Okay. Mhmm.

Them: The other block you mentioned the word blocker. You can see that I also had under the you're still oh, in that document, the first email of the p l there's a note about we're proud to share our you know Rick has extra words. I left his edits in there.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Love them, but I left them in there so you or somebody else could get you know? Except or not. But, anyway, he's we that the board has committed to 100% financial participation, Now, I want for me, it was a blocker. I want to be able to say, damn it. They all did contribute. But, of course, at this point, three people have contributed.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: Oh, that also sucks.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So you have a board meeting August 22, and I'm

Me: Yep.

Them: honestly, I really would like to have all board members. Now we can we can chain we can finesse the language they've committed to doing it, But for god's sakes, if you're gonna commit to it, just do it. But, like,

Me: I agree. Yeah. Don't even think we have so so I think I think those are connected to another. I agree. So

Them: So again, this was, you know, Rick was ready to soften the language. We can just say committed to, but I really would love it if they just did it.

Me: Right.

Them: Okay. So oh, so another idea that I had about that email is to put the exact words of the email. No changes at all.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Possibly not your signature at the bottom. We'll see. But as a blog post, And for me, there's a couple reasons to do that. One, not everybody gets our email. They'll see it as a blog post. Two, we can put a yellow banner across the top of concord.org, which we've been doing which I've been doing recently

Me: Mhmm.

Them: new blog posts. So there'd be another, like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: tiny little bit of, you know, the 100 characters that says, you know,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: appeal or board whatever, new initiative, check the board funds, whatever whatever. And three, if we do when we do a sort of fall at Concord, in quotation marks, newsletter, which is just a series of blog posts, we get

Me: Yep.

Them: send it out again.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: So that's my idea.

Me: In in general, that seems fine to me, and it may depend upon the wording whether, you know, it should be worded differently or what have you. You for the blog post as opposed to the email. But but in general, that seems like the right mode, and I agree with you.

Them: I think Rick liked it too. I think once you read the letter, if you

Me: Okay.

Them: keep that in your head, what would

Me: Good.

Them: what would it be different if it were a blog post or it it would be nice if they were exactly. In my mind,

Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: feels like they

Me: Mhmm.

Them: exactly the same. So if you keep that in your head,

Me: Yeah. Like, there's I mean, we're mailing it out to everybody, so it's not like there's any reason to you know, have it be different for the

Them: Right.

Me: quote, unquote, public thing on the web.

Them: On the agenda, I also have on here a blog post that's for you potentially to think about. So in addition to this thing called you know, with technically, it has your signature on it. So Rick and I, we're working on it.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: But if you actually wanted to write something, you know, there are a couple of idea. We've so you didn't write a perspective for the Spring at Concord, for instance.

Me: Right. Right. Mhmm.

Them: Wasn't a Spring at Concord. It was a series of blog posts. But they're continues to be

Me: Yes. Yes. Exactly. Yep.

Them: administration bashing all things science. Right? So you could write about that if you wanted to. You could write about could not be political if you don't want to, and you could just write about data science. You know? You

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: You about artificial intelligence, whatever chatty thing you wanna write about.

Me: To have something

Them: But just to be right

Me: be included with that as perspective ish. Mhmm.

Them: Yes. If you wanted to do a fall at Concord thing, if you wanted to sort of get into this new habit of publishing once or twice a year,

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Yep.

Them: Again, it's gonna be blog posts and not at Concord's anymore, but

Me: Mhmm.

Them: just to put it on your list.

Me: Yeah. That makes sense. Mhmm.

Them: The annual report, I shared the draft in Slack with you, so it's a PDF. So if you can take a look at that, not you don't have to look in real time, Chad, although I do

Me: Sure. Mhmm.

Them: have questions for you. So in real time, if you just wanna get a quick skim down the pages. It's all it's kind of a mishmash of half real text and half

Me: K.

Them: placeholder text. And so, basically, Jan is designing this for us. And, originally, Jan was gonna do this as template pages for us in InDesign so that then I would format. I would place the text and place the pictures and that sort of thing, and we would we'll we'll own the InDesign files anyway. But, you know, like, we would have temp a template

Me: Mhmm.

Them: we needed a two column page, a three column page, whatever. And about a week ago, I shared the Google document of the actual text with Jan, and she's like, oh, yeah. It is just easier to put real text in there because in in in an earlier version of this, she had this very long president's message that was like, three column and you know, it ran onto a second page whenever I'm like, oh, it's not what I have in mind.

Me: Right. Right. Mhmm.

Them: Shorter. And so so we got to this version. And so it has, like I said, it has some real text. Go back to my Google document. So some questions I have for you first of all, there's a there is a Google document, and you I wrote the president's message, but you should obviously edit it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Rewrite the entire if you need to, if you want to. One thing that then it jumps right to the three focus areas. Now these three focus areas are from the last

Me: Hi.

Them: year's form nine ninety. So data science, artificial education, and stem models. It's a little there's no nice segue right now from the president message to the three focus areas. So the so I sort of realized that after the fact and kind of, like, have kind of a half a sentence of you know, students are prepared to lead tomorrow's discoveries in

Me: Right.

Them: artificial intelligence, data science education, and models or whatever. I think that there might be another way. I think maybe there's a page between the president's message and those three focus areas that says

Me: Mhmm.

Them: in 2024, like, I wanna wanna pretend that this is like,

Me: But

Them: we're already thinking about fiscal year the '25 annual report. So like, this one can be shorter, sweeter, or whatever. But, anyway, so we could sort of have a a page that sort of says,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: we focused on these three things this year and wanna change and whatever. We have the opportunity. So that's one of my questions for you is when you have when you look at the annual report, is this sort of, like, how to get to how to

Me: Introduce yeah. I'll just sort of move into them. Yep. That makes sense.

Them: not be so how to introduce the folks. So there's that. Then another question I have for you is, so those focus areas, like I said, the the draft the text is real ish because it came from the form nine ninety. I don't love it. So it's so it's all up for grabs for sure. For the focus area pages. But one idea that I had, which Jan then implemented, was to put the list of projects here. So I for me, that feels like it adds context, content. Like, otherwise, I feel like if we're really sticking to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: sort of, like, two paragraphs, then then it's clearly sort of floofy, high high level, like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: we did great stuff in data science education. Now we don't actually

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that anyone is necessarily gonna read every project title.

Me: I agree.

Them: But having project titles feels real to me.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: So I really like it. Sue saw a draft of this on Friday morning. And Sue's comment she really loved the the layout of the these focus area pages, the block, how they're all blocked out and all that. What she like

Me: Right.

Them: is actually the fact that those were the full NSF titles because they so I I think that this is me being, like, you know, me being Cynthia, me being, like,

Me: But

Them: we can't just say data PPL because that's the actual title. Like right? But if we I think she wants the titles to be a little sexier. She didn't say sexier, but, like, a little more comprehensible or interesting or whatever. And so I you know, I swayed me. I mean, I think I agree. It's just a matter of sort of having a mapping in the end. If somebody were to say, if we don't call it neural net well, neural net finger's not on here because it's

Me: Mhmm.

Them: but a learning progression for k 12 data science education, a conference proposal.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Nope. But if we said, you know, data science learning progressions,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: like, mapping, we know that that means NSF number there. So if we said,

Me: Right. I mean and we could. It could be as simple as

Them: whatever.

Me: you know, putting the NSF number right next to it or something like that, and then it's

Them: So

Me: sort of

Them: that so so Rick saw this in my meeting with him on Thursday, and he thought of he suggested, and I don't like his idea,

Me: Oh,

Them: is to say by each one, you know, NSF, NSF, NSF department, which

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: of Health, whatever. And I he said anybody who's not living under

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: he essentially said it. He's not living under a rock knows that NSF is is, you know, not doing well. And I think he's wrong. I think that if you ask anybody on the street, they don't, in fact, know NSF. They might have heard about Medicaid cuts. They might have heard about a few things. They did not hear about NSF. Because it's it went because they on an

Me: Right?

Them: on a day to day basis, they care more about Medicaid or they know somebody on Medicaid. They

Me: Right.

Them: know about National Sign.

Me: But funders, of course, might, but

Them: Right. But he also he then thought his rationale was put NSF Right? Because then people who've heard of it and know about it will know

Me: Mhmm.

Them: oh gosh, Concord is you know, might have the rug pulled out from under them because certain SUS thought, oh, shit. Then it looks how poorly we've managed

Me: But

Them: our own finances over these years. If we've solely support if we've been solely relying on NSF.

Me: mhmm.

Them: And why the hell were we not diversifying years ago?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So I don't even wanna have that conversation because the pros and the cons of adding NSF or Valhalla, whatever, I think for me, my goal, as I said, was content.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Was there's something real. There's a name. I could look it up on a project page on concord.org if I wanted to. I can learn I could ask you. I'm a funder. And what is that data and space and time? That sounds really fun.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know?

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Good question. Okay.

Them: So I want you to think so all the questions around the names of the projects, whether or not they should be the real name, the shortened name that we use on concord.org, like data PBL, like data in space multicontent, whatever it is, multidimensional learning. You know, like, all these sort of things. Or some kind of, like, in between. It doesn't have to be data PBL, but it doesn't have to be contextualizing data,

Me: Right. Right.

Them: Something that so

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that's another sort of question. A couple more questions have to do with the the last page, the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: supporters page.

Me: Sorry.

Them: So those Jan just mocked this up quickly from logos from the 2013 annual report. And so I asked Rick who what just and he just got back to me this morning. I wrote to him over the weekend.

Me: Mhmm. Alright.

Them: What logos should we consider using here for support? Is is it obviously NSF Department of Education, yada yada. And as many foundations, right, Sorry. As many, yeah, foundations, you know, The Noise Foundation or or whatever. You know? I'm just But what else? Like, where do we draw the line? Because right now,

Me: Right.

Them: go to concord.org, if you go to our collaborators page, it's so out of date

Me: Right. Right.

Them: It's so out of date.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So I remember I just noticed recently, like, NetApp isn't on there, for instance. Like, these kind of

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Right.

Them: just, like, all of a sudden, you're kinda like, oh, wow. So this page Rick said, great question. Right now, put as many as you want, all of them. He just basically said all of them.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And he said, then Danielle next year can decide

Me: Mhmm.

Them: what kind of, like, makes the list.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Are they outdated at some point? Excuse me. So, like, and then he liked the idea. It was actually Sue's idea on Friday. To say, and supporters like you, you know, and generous supporters like you. Like, every

Me: Yeah. That's good. Mhmm.

Them: ever did. You know?

Me: Yep.

Them: So so this back page, I I had actually mocked it up and then Jan used my design. I wanted a teacher photo. We have the great kid photos, and I wanted a teacher photo on the back. I'm now thinking that if we're gonna do lots and lots of support a page, we might have a whole page

Me: Mhmm.

Them: of just support, and then the back page becomes sort of just the half and half of

Me: Mhmm.

Them: teacher photo, contact information, and it's kind of a nice white you know, you can breathe kind of page.

Me: Yep. Yep. I can see either way.

Them: So it it depends on how many

Me: Mhmm.

Them: right now, it depends on the number of logos we want to

Me: Yep.

Them: I asked Sue on Friday. She said to ask Rick, so I asked him over the weekend. He said everything. So it affects design and affects

Me: Yeah. In terms of I'm fine with everything too. I mean, I think the

Them: everything from the

Me: think the question you know, mostly

Them: well,

Me: is it only the supporters from this last year, but then it's pretty meager meager, or is it just people who support us? And I think we wanna tell the lot of story we can of being active.

Them: Great.

Me: I think I think every everything, you know, that makes sense seems good to me.

Them: Right. And the the question is that making sense? If you go to concord.org and if you go to the about in the collaborators page,

Me: Right.

Them: it's right now split between

Me: I

Them: so collaborators or whatever the top people are, top group, and then so called supporters. So under the supporters, from concord.org, there's NSF department, Google, Pearson, McGraw Hill, and MIT Museum, William k Bose Foundation, and so on. I can't even tell you, though, why sometimes we have, like, Michigan like, Michigan State University.

Me: Right. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. I mean, I think

Them: So there's

Me: I think the supporters should be funding sources of some type or another more than it is collaborators. I mean, we could choose to have a collaborators page too, but then it gets enormous in this, you know, and or

Them: enormous

Me: yeah.

Them: Right.

Me: I mean, we could. You could list collaborators in text and then have

Them: So

Me: supporters be logos if you really wanted to do that. But, you know, I don't know where you draw the line on Clever is either. I mean and that might be about

Them: Right.

Me: question. Is it really mean, it's impressive story. So maybe we actually do wanna have a, you know, eight point font list of of, you know, collaborators. I'm not sure.

Them: And and those collaboratives would be every university that we've ever collaborated with over

Me: I don't know. I mean, I'm just trying to think through that page. But, I mean, clearly, you could do that. Right?

Them: It could.

Me: But I don't know if it would buy us, you know, value or or be just really crazy confusing.

Them: So

Me: But but

Them: this is, you know, my and by

Me: order seems like it should be funders of orders to me.

Them: supported as okay. So supported as funders. So I can ask you know, first of all, should update the Concord we should update our website as well. At the bottom half of that page, at the very least, the this collaborator's we call the and maybe we should flip it. Maybe we should put supporters first And once we get an updated list and then collaborators because that's super

Me: Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Mhmm. Yeah. Yep.

Them: super outdated, but we could

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: eventually get to that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Alright. So all supporters in terms of money. Anybody who gave us

Me: Yep.

Them: us money. Alright. And then the last question, for the annual report, but it gets into the next question as well of single source of truth for numbers. Is on the impact page of this so on the annual report PDF there, page seven, there's one single impact page, and it

Me: Yep.

Them: comes from again, it comes from form nine ninety. In an early version of this, annual report that Jan gave me and you can still see it actually on page because she just added page 10 with the board of directors. These kind of blocks for, like, impressive number

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: Right? Those point 2,000,000 website users I am always incredibly uncomfortable talking numbers. I because I feel like we don't have a single source of truth. And so if you so that's my next bullet point in our agenda. We've got that form nine ninety, which

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: I meant to link to here. I can put the link. Anyway,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: there's your dashboard. There's we Kylie recently did this Concord Impact data, which lives on the shared strategic development drive. I just found that the other day

Me: Right.

Them: I'm like, oh, great. Great. New Google Analytics numbers without

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Exactly.

Them: don't know where they come from, and I don't know you know? The exact dates around them and all this kind of crap.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: It's not a question we're gonna answer in real time right here, Chad, but it makes me personally crazy

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: to not even when I look at the form nine ninety again, I'll find the spreadsheet and link in here, but you might remember that there have been some years where, like, it should go up. It's cumulative. And then then one year, went down. You're like, it is cumulative. It literally cannot go down.

Me: Yep.

Them: And then it did. And then there was a note from Aden at one point or something. It was, like, having to do,

Me: Yeah.

Them: stitching together Google Analytics reports, and it was missing

Me: Yeah. Because Google Analytics changed itself at one point, and that's, you know, accumulative. Right?

Them: But still, I and then, you know,

Me: Yeah.

Them: Paul's different work that he has done on our on our portal, whatever. It makes me nuts

Me: Yeah.

Them: I it's fine that it makes me nuts. But

Me: Yeah. No. It's gonna us to, I think, you know and

Them: you

Me: and they all should, you know, they should come you know, come together. I think we're closer to it maybe than ever right now, both because we're asking the questions, we have risen to be these numbers up more so than in the past, because Leslie and Kylie are wringing their hands around not being able to get numbers that they want out of the portal and research back end to the time as Paul's been doing some of this work. So I think that I think there's a head brewing like, let's make it easier to get our numbers. And really, there are there really are only two sources of truth. It's essentially our portal and and Google Analytics. And, you know, we were starting to pull from our have interest and and, you know, momentum in pulling from both of those in ways that are more consistent. So

Them: Six Right. But it's also, like, having five different dashboards and

Me: I think we can get there, much better than we could in the past. Right. Is that yeah. That that's crazy making.

Them: and spreadsheets and, like, all this sort of stuff. So this came up obviously, this came up in a couple places. One, I wanted to write something impact y for an annual report. Separately, Rick asked me for a starter paragraph, like, 100 word paragraph. This is gonna be our next messaging next bullet point.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Jenna two is updated messaging.

Me: Right.

Them: Like, a 100 word paragraph about the conference consortium?

Me: Right.

Them: I I grab something from a proposal and sent it to him. Over the weekend, he edited it, sent it back to me. Early this morning, I sent it back to him. And then he said, is it 3,000,000 or 1,000,000? Like, I've heard both numbers that. And I was like, wait. The three mine I'm like, numbers make me crazy. Don't quote me. Sort of like but the 3,000,000 is

Me: Yep.

Them: users or visitors to our websites.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: It's literal and I put in parenthesis in my email to Rick Concord dot org. And then so website visitors versus teachers and students, teachers on the order of remember, 89, 90,000 user excuse me. Teachers on learn.conga.org. And, like, 1,400,000 students cumulative

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: on on lauren.com.org. Anyway, it's a humongous difference between

Me: Yep.

Them: website hits,

Me: Right.

Them: and registered accounts.

Me: Definitely is. And, you know, and the issue is that website hits our two at least types, you know, in that people who've visit lab.concord.org embedded in something, you know, should be kinda the those count as users in one way, shape, or form. I mean, the fact that somebody is an active user in the portal and assigned something is big. That's great because they took effort, but it doesn't mean

Them: Yeah.

Me: I mean, Open Sight is giving us hits on Seismic Explorer all the time that never are gonna show up and learn. So we're gonna have to count Google Analytics in some way, shape, or form as, you know, as real users. You know, where we draw that line, I'm not quite

Them: I well, right. But we need somebody like I said,

Me: sure. But yeah. Totally. Mhmm. Yep. I agree.

Them: my can see my header for this of course, the truth. I don't care. Like, whoever wants to own it, because you know what?

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: You're gonna have to defend it. So I care.

Me: Yep.

Them: I don't care. Like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I it makes me nuts You know? But if you wanna say there are 1,500,000 code app users and you define

Me: Yep.

Them: users however you define them, great. Go for it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But you need to back it up. When Cisco says, where did you get the 1,500,000? It can't be out of my rear end. Like, you have to

Me: Yeah.

Them: happen. Right?

Me: Yep. Totally.

Them: Sorry, Chad. So so again, for and I want you when you're this is back to the annual report. When you're reviewing the annual report, I just for me, Chad, a little bit of sort of, like,

Me: Yes.

Them: let's not aim for perfection. We want this on our website.

Me: Totally. Yep.

Them: So I want to my goal is to get this up

Me: Mhmm. Good.

Them: by August 31, which by the way, is another reason for that appeal to go the email appeal is the more we have backing on our website, the whole the the donate pay we have the financial information page on our website already.

Me: Yep.

Them: But if we already have an annual report there too, we've got Daniel's bio. Like,

Me: Yep.

Them: we become a more real

Me: Yep. Mhmm. Yep.

Them: charitable organization, five zero one c three, and make a donation. Like, we have all of the pieces in place. So I want this annual report. I want it

Me: Yep. I agree.

Them: look. I wanna do a nice job. Of course, I do. But I don't wanna wait to get numbers and figure it all out. I just want

Me: Yep. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: and then we can start working on our 2025 right away. We can have, like,

Me: Yep.

Them: profiles of, like, awesome teachers or profiles of kids or, like, longer stories, all the stuff that we might do. But this one, just want kinda short and sweet and done.

Me: I told I totally agree. And, you know, and by the way, realize that nobody's gonna, you know, discount us in some way if that number on the PDF that you download September 20 is different than the number on the PDF you download August 30, like, we have the InDesign files, so we could also update the numbers on the impact on that annual on that report. You know, it's it's not like a legal record. So so I would, you know, design for what we want and use the numbers that we think are good. And and in the background, we'll update the numbers to signal source of truth, and we can bring them into reconciliation because it's probably better that they, you know, match the website, you know, when we get there you know, we get it all said and done than it is that we have it perfect for 2024 or whatever that means.

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Okay. Good. The link here, update our messaging, I I did actually share this with I think I shared this with Rick. I'm pretty sure I did. Because just this idea of, like, describing ourselves, this is

Me: Right. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: obviously so ridiculously old.

Me: Yep.

Them: Right? It's not that it's they're still good still good gems within there, but

Me: Yeah.

Them: obviously, you're missing anything having to do most things with data plans or with artificial intelligence and so on.

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: But I just wanted to remind us that we have this.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And that, again, about

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Our Google Slide template because it

Me: Yep.

Them: really interested in branding and, you know, that's why he wants the one paragraph. And then asking for the one paragraph is is like what this was. It was this this idea of, like,

Me: Yep.

Them: if you're filling out a form and you need 200 words or use the or whatever it is,

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: So we're back at that point of and with having Danielle on board.

Me: That's good.

Them: So I wanted to again, this is obviously not real time, but but remind you and think about these words and how

Me: Yep.

Them: how we got there and how we update it for 2025\.

Me: Totally agree. Yep.

Them: So when when we met in person, couple weeks ago, you asked me about user discovery, finding 75 teachers.

Me: Open it. Any access to that one. Yep.

Them: So you click on the first list the first one.

Me: There's some IPs one. Yep.

Them: Oh, the user discovery? I'm sorry.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Alright. And my page won't ruin share. I thought I put it in the anyway, I meant to put it on oh, it's right on my Sorry. I'll move it to strategic If you re reload the page, you should have access. I these are just some ideas. So we have 25 future ambassadors. We have

Me: Mhmm.

Them: innovator interviews from Concord newsletters. So I put Renee in red because she was kind of a dud. She was kinda hard

Me: Sure.

Them: She was but just really hard to get in touch with. It's So then we have these blog posts that I wrote the, like, beginning of the year blog posts. So I color coded because Carla was also a teacher ambassador and so on and so forth. But the some of the blue ones,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Tim and Scott, they're fabulous from the MCM project with Sage Model. They they wrote it at Concord. I'm sorry. They wrote a science scope part

Me: Oh, nice. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Anyway, so there's that. And then another idea was I finally got access to SurveyMonkey after

Me: Oh,

Them: painful idea painful

Me: absolutely.

Them: deal with passwords. But, anyway,

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: there was an NSCA short survey, Chad,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that you did. That you said, if you'd be willing to take part in a brief interview,

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: we'll contact you.

Me: Great. Good.

Them: And, of course, we never did, but now we can.

Me: Yep. Mhmm. Nice.

Them: So there are 12 people who gave their email addresses there.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: And if you link, there is it's actually linked. That's a link right there. We also have an earth science teacher survey, which Trudy has ongoing, and she's had it going on for literally four years or something like that. I reminded her of this the other day. Because she's gonna be recruiting for a new online class

Me: Right.

Them: to spend down some youth pick participants for money. But, anyway, there are literally 300 earth science teachers including six sit of in 2025\.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: So you know, not not like the twenty twenty teachers, but very recent.

Me: Well, it's getting there, though.

Them: So that's not your 75 but then right. Well, then I noticed that Kylie So the rest of that's, 40 right there. And then the other link under user discovery is Kylie apparent I found this on our

Me: Nice.

Them: shared drive. It's Carly Kylie did this.

Me: Nice. That's awesome.

Them: So there you go.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So we have so many teachers that we can contact either because they didn't use wildfire a lot or because they did or whatever whatever. But

Me: Good. Good. Good. Yeah. That's great.

Them: so what I what I thought we mine is a Google document, and I had just started. I literally created a spreadsheet and didn't didn't put a single thing in it. But the idea was to have a spreadsheet of kind of, like, name, email address, where the like, NSTA, know, versus

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: Cynthia knew about them as a teacher ambassador or

Me: Yep.

Them: interview for at Concord ever. So you had categories of people, and you could either choose a half a dozen from that category or that category or these are the these are the teachers who love us, and these are the teachers who said crappy things about us. Whatever it is. Like,

Me: Yep. Yep. I think I think that I think that's exactly right. I think, you know,

Them: we just fine too. I

Me: a Google Sheet for now is the the right place to go with it. Because, mostly, we wanna figure out which names to pull for which reasons. And that's the most fungible way to to organize that for the moment. Mhmm. That's great.

Them: Right. So the there's all kinds of in Okay? So that's just and there's more, but, like, that's

Me: Sure.

Them: getting there. I'm gonna talk fast. We've got three more minutes.

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: The stem re the re oh, sorry. My god.

Me: Yeah. I mean, Yeah. Yeah. That's yeah.

Them: That mean that was supposed to say renaming. Trudy's Paul. No. Trudy's I love Trudy. She doesn't get to rename the STEM resource finder. I did not vote because I was gonna say, what the hell? What but, anyway, Chad,

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: this comes up from time to time. Mostly from. It makes me crazy. If you wanna change the name, by all means, Chad, But this like, random voting on random names

Me: Yep.

Them: in a poll is not the way to do this.

Me: I agree. I I agree on that. And, you know, the name piece, I can go various ways on and, you know, haven't thought too much about it besides when it when it bubbles up. Maybe it's an issue, maybe it's not. I'm not sure. You know, I think my what I did was try to put in some examples as I was finding them in real time to show that I don't know that anybody really grapples with this besides kinda kicking it down the road. I mean, some places sort of call it a thing, but other places just have a page and they use the word resources or they don't or whatever. So how how important the branding is is is a valid question to ask. And it may be that it's 10% of teapot because nobody cares what the branding is. It's just they want the link. And I

Them: Yeah. Well right.

Me: and I think they you know, I think if anything arose in that little

Them: They just want

Me: back and forth, it was that people, like, learn you know, in in various instantiations, and people like the URL. Okay. That's good. You know, noting that is is valuable.

Them: I know. For me, though, having the somebody several people voted for having the

Me: Yeah.

Them: title of it be learn.conquer.org.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Which is not a title .conquered.org is literally not a title.

Me: Yep.

Them: It's five words. It's stupid. Alright. I so we somehow, Chad, you need to, like,

Me: Right.

Them: have Trudy love you. You don't get to rename it. Kind of conversation. Kathy, the question here two things. The making Daisy so the Daisy project page, was turned off again, so flip a switch. From

Me: Mhmm.

Them: inactive to active. So now that Concord has now that it has transferred funds for real, I can flip it back on if we want. I don't know. The end date confuses me because

Me: Mhmm.

Them: on research dot not research.gov. On the NSF award search, it's funded through October. But I had thought we had funding through March. So is she gonna have to do a no cost

Me: Oh god. I don't even know about that. That's a good question. Yeah. I'm not sure.

Them: extension? Like, I just I oh, right. I can wait to I actually, I did mention this to Sue on Friday, and she said talk to you. So and the other question about Kathy is that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you probably saw Kathy's email back to the

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: ONR guy. And she was like, oh, we've had good stuff, and we're gonna submit another white paper. Lisa wrote to me this morning, and she said, oh my god. Did you see Kathy's email? Submit another white paper. Does that mean another proposal? And I said, listen. My understanding is that Kathy's not submitting anything through Concord. So maybe she does intend to submit

Me: Well, I don't even I don't even know that there's a white paper or thing to submit to. I mean,

Them: through whatever other affiliation, but not through Concord.

Me: they're they're still processing that first one. So I think it's kind of irrelevant at the point is my guess. Right.

Them: But Kathy being Kathy, it's like this

Me: Mhmm.

Them: possibilities that she didn't hear you and Sue. She didn't process it, that she can't submit through Concord anymore, whatever. But

Me: Yep.

Them: just that it's out there, just to keep an eye on her ideas about the o and r at some future white paper submitting blah blah blah. Negative twenty seconds here. The CLUE website, I don't know what I still there was this idea of convergence and whatever. And I just wanted to

Me: Yeah.

Them: I there was one more point that I had lost when when I didn't like the idea of a collection page, and here's the reason is and I remember it because Frida and Letty and I have two papers that have been

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and will be published this fall. One's in Science Scope and one's in Statistics Teacher.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And they're both about data biographies.

Me: Right.

Them: And data biographies live on Concord live on mourn.concord.org.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: They're not they're not for teachers to assign. So it's so stupid. It's

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: so dumb. It's it's a it's a web page. It should and so I had this conversation with Freedom. I'm like,

Me: Yep.

Them: scratching my head. Like, this was, you know, two, three months ago when we were writing these articles. I'm like, what the hell? Why are they there? And she's she's like, oh, because I had access to that, and I could easily create them. It was kinda like the wrap And this is exactly why one of reasons why. If I had known that, I would have argued against it you know, a year and a half ago whenever Dave Iyer was doing this. Because I feel like it dilutes and weirds out our STEM resource finder. Like, you go to a collection page and they're not assignable activities there, and now we're using just that page for marketing, for clue, whatever. I just it's I can't have like, we're over time right now, but this I really need I need us to think about the STEM resource finder.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Imagine your teacher, she goes into

Me: Yeah. No. I think I think we all I think we all agree that in

Them: that she know always over there and

Me: check\-in with Liz right after this so I can, you know, see where she's on it. But think we all agree that that the collections page is not the end state for a clue website. You know, anything, I think Leslie was like, oh, it's just easier for me to roll it similar to something. Right? You got the

Them: That is not the reason. It is not.

Me: Right. No. And I and I was I heard that and had the same inkling, so I feel like we should just make it happen as a as a website that we can vary in in lots of ways. I'll I'll check with her about that. But yeah. Mhmm.

Them: And if it's a work

Me: Yeah.

Them: right, And, again so first of all, it's straight old fashioned HTML on learn whereas a WordPress, there's a nice, cute little WYSIWYG editor.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yep. I agree.

Them: So WordPress is not difficult to update. Alrighty. Well, the last was the data science page updates because the there are some broken things. This is the concord.org/datafluency. It's the

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: the Right. So I had I just actually I'd forgotten about it, but I had Slacked you about it a while ago. And then when I Slacking you this morning, I'm like, oh, yeah. I forgot I asked you about that.

Me: Okay.

Them: So I put it on here so it's on this list.

Me: Alright.

Them: So, Chad, the email to subscribers

Me: Those two those two are on my list from this one. So

Them: and the annual report are, like, the big

Me: yeah.

Them: big priorities.

Me: Alright. Very good. Thanks.

Them: Okay. Thank you.

Me: Bye. Mhmm.

Them: Bye.
