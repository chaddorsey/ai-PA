Transcript:

Me: But Hello.

Them: Oh, did I I gotta did I plug this in? I didn't. Plug this in. Hi.

Me: Hi. How are you doing?

Them: I'm okay. I if I if this morning hadn't been so crazy and I had packed food, I could've just gone some

Me: Oh, yeah. Whatever.

Them: back to the office after meeting Judy. But

Me: That's fine. Mhmm.

Them: is coming along.

Me: Yes. Mostly mostly done with the I mean, I did first draft that people reviewed yesterday, you know, chewing away on some of the comments and things, but there are the list is getting smaller and just need to make some graphics and then, you do a a more full read through again. So it's it's in decent shape.

Them: Good. Did you did you

Me: Mhmm.

Them: did Lisa she probably got it by now. She had posted something about you as a CEO couldn't be the PI Did that get resolved? It was like a bureau of

Me: Yeah. There's there's stuff there I know. Yeah.

Them: labor code. Did you

Me: I don't know where she ended up on it, but let's see. See the

Them: Wait.

Me: It it sounds like they figured things out.

Them: Maybe somebody responded. Yeah.

Me: Julian. I don't know who Julian Julian is. I think maybe she talked to

Them: Oh,

Me: somebody at NSF.

Them: yeah. So maybe

Me: Okay. We just need to review the budget, I think.

Them: Yeah. I'll take a look and see where we might need further justification, because she said the way she was breaking it down, she said, I don't know if these cover everyone's 75% salary. My guess is that Chad and Cynthia may still need justification given their position and seniority.

Me: Right. Yeah. That was earlier, and it sounds like she's made progress since

Them: That

Me: then. So but we still need to review review the budget. So

Them: okay. That's moved forward. Okay. I just

Me: I haven't seen Dan responding, but

Them: I want to make sure she wasn't left hanging because you hadn't had a chance to

Me: yeah. Exactly.

Them: focus on that as opposed to just writing the narrative.

Me: Well, she she is hanging right you know, it's a good question, she's hanging right now waiting for somebody to review it. So I'm

Them: Okay.

Me: waiting to see if Diana's around, and, otherwise, I'll dig I'll dig in

Them: Okay. Kudos to you for getting your Chad's Corner done.

Me: Yeah. I got that done this morning finally.

Them: Little early, Good. Let's see. So Judy and I did a test with Glowforge.

Me: Yeah. I talked to the talked to her about that in the meeting That one actually had some other issues because it controls the account for logging in anyway, so I may try to flip that back. But, you know, she and I talked about, you know, accounts that we

Them: Okay.

Me: sort of manage too. So it was a good intro to thinking about how to manage accounts, I think. I did. Yes.

Them: Have you canceled DreamHost yet? Okay. Good. And you let her know?

Me: Canceled that that that at that time. Yes. I told her. Mhmm.

Them: Okay.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then because when I was looking at it, was like, there's about

Me: Yeah.

Them: five that are recurring.

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And I said to her that, you know, once we've got that list and we see what's a pain and what isn't, then, you know, maybe that I can automate a couple of them in some different way, and it may be that there are a couple left and I could decide we could decide piecemeal whether transfer them to orders because it lends itself to that or it's just something I have to log in know, like, Techie Petite can't transfer because it's all a fixed account. Right?

Them: Yeah. Well and because some of them are set up as c Dorsey plus. And I don't know if Chad Dorsey if Chad TBT would

Me: Mhmm. Right. That too. Yeah. Neither one. But it doesn't

Them: would cover that.

Me: necessarily matter. That's just a slightly easier way to identify emails from them, but you

Them: Right.

Me: still fill filter the emails and forward them if you got emails too. So

Them: Okay.

Me: Mhmm. So, yeah, it should it should be tracked

Them: The and the other thing is did she talk

Me: Yeah.

Them: about chatty PT and reducing the licenses

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Okay.

Me: Yep. That was on my mind the other day. So

Them: And the other thing I've talked to her about this.

Me: mhmm.

Them: But I hadn't circled back with you. But there was a we were trying to nail down the most recent charge to Dropbox, and it's from my account.

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: So my plan is to cancel it It will probably be the very end of the day because

Me: Sure. Yep.

Them: of the board you know, stuff.

Me: Mhmm. That's perfectly fine.

Them: So when I get that, I will forward it to you. I think what I might say to Judy maybe cancel my email

Me: Mhmm.

Them: on Tuesday so that

Me: Right. It has time to clear

Them: inserts or whoever like, if it if I don't get the confirmation email from

Me: Right.

Them: Dropbox before I you know, sit with Insource to scrub my computer,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so that you guys can get it.

Me: Yeah. That makes sense.

Them: So I don't know if she legally and ethically will feel comfortable with that, but

Me: I think I I think we can manage if we know that we're trying you know, get things that are

Them: extract something.

Me: clear and canceled. And the other thing is for what it's worth, with something that's monthly, canceling it doesn't you know, stop access until the month flips over anyway.

Them: True.

Me: So with most thing, you could cancel today and you'd still log in to your Hulu account

Them: True. Good point.

Me: or Dropbox account for, you know,

Them: Yeah. Right.

Me: whatever. Mean, it might be one day. It might be thirty. Right? Mhmm.

Them: Right. Every every

Me: Mhmm.

Them: place has their own policy. I'll see if I'll make sure I share those details.

Me: Because we paid for the month, so I think

Them: Right.

Me: probably you can, you know, look at when it flips over and maybe you might be able to cancel it earlier.

Them: Right. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Okay. And the other thing is what would you how do you want me to leave my outgoing message? For people who

Me: Mhmm.

Them: because I do sometimes will get messages saying, hey, Sarah. Can can I

Me: Right. That's a good question. I mean, I think

Them: get some time with Chad?

Me: should be you know, you should refer them to me for sure.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And I mean, you could So, I mean, you could forward everything to me, and I could just throw it into a label and look at that label every now and then. Is one option. Or, you know, it might be just as easy or better if, you know, if it just said, I'm sorry, I'm not available, but contact Chad directly for questions about, you know, scheduling or Concord business or what have you. I mean, something like that.

Them: Yeah. I don't

Me: Probably the easiest I don't get all the spam that comes to your account too or

Them: right. Right. So I don't think I think there should be too many.

Me: Yeah.

Them: I've been trying to clean it out and like, starting to unsubscribe from you know, various newsletters that I've gotten. So

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: hopefully, it will slow way down.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And the people who are the ones who might contact me directly for a meeting with you are the people who'll be like, Oh, I'll just contact Chad. You know, it's

Me: Exactly. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: it's Andy. It's Lee. It's

Me: Yeah. Yep.

Them: you know,

Me: Yep.

Them: people who I've

Me: Mhmm.

Them: worked with for years.

Me: But but I agree that having some message, you know, so that they don't sit there expecting a reply and

Them: Right.

Me: know, nothing is good.

Them: Right. Right.

Me: Yeah. Yep.

Them: Okay. And then I went to register you for NSTA, and I was like, you wanna go to this? And what do you wanna do about food?

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: So I don't remember this in the past, but you can sign up for a Voxlap. Lunch. Maybe they did that before, and I just didn't register it.

Me: I don't know. I think it sounds like it's new, but I certainly don't need it

Them: Okay.

Me: I mean, it conferences, I rarely have anything till maybe dinnertime. And even then, not necessarily that much. So Mhmm.

Them: And my guess is that you'll probably I was thinking well, you'll probably

Me: Yeah.

Them: connect with people and

Me: Exactly.

Them: you know, hey, let's go get some

Me: Yeah.

Them: get some food. So okay. So then I'll go ahead and finish that registration. And I'll I'll give Judy a heads up that that will come through on Amex.

Me: That's good. Yep.

Them: And I haven't seen the Amex yet, but

Me: No.

Them: I don't get the sense that you've ordered like, Amazon or stuff like that.

Me: I don't think so.

Them: And did she remind you about the check

Me: Yeah. I

Them: for the hotel?

Me: forgotten about that totally, so I stuck that in OmniFocus and

Them: Okay.

Me: should be able to remember that. Mhmm.

Them: And I was going through the board stuff

Me: Mhmm.

Them: from Lisa, There were a couple things that I just added to Omnifocus that were related to

Me: Okay. Good.

Them: licensing models and code app and just things in OmniFocus that I'm not sure whether

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: not sure how I hadn't I hadn't scanned OmniFocus to see, oh, did he already put this in?

Me: Yeah. No. Those are good questions because I probably didn't in the the heat of the moment in the board meeting.

Them: Yeah. Have you had a chance to do any of the small things Like, apply to Andy,

Me: Not too much yet, Andy. You can be a little bit

Them: Andrew,

Me: still, Andrew. Ross, I can do whenever. Leslie and I talked about the Sabbath email, so I'll think I have a better sense of what to do with that response now.

Them: Okay.

Me: So and

Them: Kudo boards.

Me: and this yep. When this proposal is done, then I can take a little bit of time and get to little things too.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully, it'll be done

Me: Yeah. These needs to be turned in. It needs to be submitted

Them: today. It has to be done today.

Me: also. It'll be done.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Yep.

Them: Yeah. Okay. I will send a little note just don't know. Have you talked to Helen recently? I I send her a note in the morning, but

Me: Yeah. I haven't talked to her today at all. She I did get a card

Them: alright. Okay.

Me: you know, or a letter from her for this proposal earlier in the week. But I didn't talk about this in that. So

Them: Yep. Alright. I'll just send her a reminder email just so

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. That that seems good.

Them: doesn't get lost. And, I haven't heard anything from Pam

Me: Yeah.

Them: And at this point, I

Me: I'll

Them: probably it's better for you to schedule anything

Me: that's fine. Yep. I will I will send her again next week, you know, when I

Them: Okay.

Me: don't hear anything yet, which I

Them: Yeah.

Me: probably won't. Because it's been off our radar.

Them: Okay. Do you there's a meeting thing that I haven't answered because I don't know. The, development meeting later in September for DSE and Valhalla. Do you do you need to attend? It's with Ethan and Leslie, Cynthia, Mike, and Kylie.

Me: Yeah. I think is it on is it an event that's already on the calendar?

Them: It's on the calendar. I just have an accepted it for you. It's September 22\. I because sometimes you go to those, but then sometimes somebody else goes.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. This one, is it sprint planning meeting? Or something separate?

Them: It's a t one development meeting.

Me: Okay.

Them: What's it called?

Me: I would I guess, put

Them: One dev

Me: yeah, you can

Them: websites, d e s e in Valhalla.

Me: you can say yeah, you can say optional for me because I'm still figuring out what you know, how much I need to be involved in that, but I am gonna do some stuff while Leslie's gone

Them: Okay.

Me: to try to push the ball forward on it a little bit. So I may end up

Them: Okay.

Me: it should stay on my radar in case I want him to join it for sure.

Them: And I'm gonna

Me: Yeah.

Them: Kate's away. I think she's away for another week.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Which really puts like only two weeks before possible dates for the DST group to reconvene.

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: So I don't

Me: I think they I think we decided on some

Them: for I if I could look through your email and see if

Me: look at the meeting notes.

Them: at the meeting note there was no resolution because Kate and I Slacked about this and she said,

Me: Yeah.

Them: there there were some afternoon meeting or, yeah, they were teaching in the

Me: The one Lauren has Lauren has

Them: I don't know who

Me: is you know, it's hard for her to be available but we did get some dates that worked for her. And then, you know, it's a two follow\-up and then have to travel, I think. But we should be able to find what those

Them: Maybe the best thing is just for me to send a note

Me: this

Them: and copy Kate and you

Me: Yeah. Probably.

Them: just saying, you know, Kate Kate's in Tennessee working on her project These are the tentative dates for your next meeting when Kate gets back, she'll resolve everything. I think that's probably the way to go.

Me: Yeah. So Tuesday and Thursday mornings work for Lauren. For what it's worth. So you can can put that in as a reminder if it's useful.

Them: Well, then we run into the issue with Chris. Because he his time zone is five

Me: Yeah. But we won't for long because he's gonna be he's it won't be for long. He's gonna be in New York soon. Yeah.

Them: oh, he's oh, he's oh, I didn't know when he was moving. It was coming to New York. Oh,

Me: His wife's teaching at Ithaca in Ithaca at Cornell. So so that changed that for him.

Them: So at okay. So he's out the week of the fifteenth. So starting the twenty second, he's in the eastern time zone?

Me: Probably. I'm not sure. But I would you know, even if he can't be there, I would propose

Them: Close to it.

Me: for the other people. So I I think I think you can just send the the reminder note and, you know, and say,

Them: Yep.

Me: know, Lauren mentioned that she was available Tuesday and Thursday mornings in particular and not available

Them: Oh, I thought you did did you just say she teaches those mornings, or she's free?

Me: No. She's she's free Tuesday, Thursday mornings. She can't do afternoons Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

Them: Okay. I'll just try and get the ball rolling so that

Me: Got it. Great.

Them: the dates are out there.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And then it can be resolved. Because the first hold date is September 23\. No.

Me: Mhmm. Which may maybe

Them: Okay.

Me: where it is. I don't know. Mhmm.

Them: I think I put four holds on the calendar. I have to double check. Okay. And then I'm going to get the board notes and summary

Me: Okay.

Them: ready in pages, but did Judy mention to you like, I've got some of it done, but did Judy mention to you that she noticed there were some discrepancies

Me: Yeah. She said she and Lisa needed to or did, I don't know, sit down and

Them: They did.

Me: yeah.

Them: Did it yesterday. So I said, well, that's good because I didn't start working on it until last night.

Me: Yeah. That's good. Yeah. No. That's good.

Them: So I think it should be okay. But just remember that you'll need to look at

Me: Yeah. That's a good point.

Them: it really carefully. Maybe more carefully than usual.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So that the wrong information doesn't go out.

Me: Right.

Them: Okay. I think that is every Do you the only other thing do you Cynthia let me start over. Cynthia suggested with Pose work and the submission tomorrow, do you still think the group

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: the grants group should meet?

Me: I'm probably not.

Them: Okay.

Me: But, you know, it's possible anyway depending upon driving schedules. We may wanna meet a half hour earlier anyway because if I'm if I'm getting Liam, then I have to leave at 11:30\. So

Them: Okay.

Me: I think we should cancel that.

Them: And then we can move ours up.

Me: And we can our time up exactly.

Them: Okay. Alright. And you have to send Becca her stuff.

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: Have you gotten anything from Sue yet?

Me: No. But I've got a meeting with her right after this.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So I can ask her there.

Them: She's probably I know it's on her radar,

Me: Yeah.

Them: Hopefully it dropped with everything else, but

Me: It's yeah. It shouldn't be hard anyway because it's really just

Them: okay.

Me: like, three three numbers or something.

Them: Okay. Alright. I think that's everything for today.

Me: Okay. Thank you.

Them: Alright. Good luck with the rest of pose.

Me: Alright. Thanks a lot.

Them: Bye.

Me: Bye.
