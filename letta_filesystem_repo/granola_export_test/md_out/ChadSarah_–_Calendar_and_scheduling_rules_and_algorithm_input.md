Transcript:

Me: Hello?

Them: Hi. How are you?

Me: I'm okay. How are you?

Them: Can you hold on one second? I just have to see if this is a doc.

Me: No problem. Sure.

Them: Okay.

Me: Okay.

Them: How are you doing? Excellent. Let's see. Everything got sorted with Paulo and Leah. For the Spencer conversation.

Me: Oh, okay.

Them: I don't know how much time you guys actually need. I just put in for forty minutes.

Me: That's probably fine. It's probably more than enough. Is

Them: It's tomorrow morning. I think

Me: Aditi actually able to come as well? I know she's got other stuff.

Them: I think so. The other spot she couldn't

Me: Okay.

Them: So,

Me: Yep.

Them: I'm hoping it works out. Way I left it with Leah is you know, if for some reason she can only only be there for a little bit, you know, I'm sure that you know, they can have conversations via email and just to

Me: Yeah.

Them: be in touch if they wanna

Me: Yeah.

Them: talk again. I mean, my understanding is that this is to sort of get the lay of the land, get a better sense of what they're thinking of to determine how Concord might

Me: Yeah. I think so.

Them: be supportive in consulting. Right?

Me: Mean yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's it's not a I mean, it's not a big project. It's tiny, actually. So it's more a matter of calibrating to help them use the right language and ideas in their planning proposal than it is anything else.

Them: Yeah. Okay. Do you want me to find an new slot for an individual check\-in with Bill since the co code app discussion's happening or

Me: Yeah. I was trying to about whether I wanted to talk with him beforehand or not just to see right after this if I wanna check\-in with him for a few minutes that meeting. And if not, then I'll let you know, and you can find a different a different time.

Them: A different time to check\-in.

Me: And yeah.

Them: Okay. And Dan had said you guys had a chance to check\-in earlier this week.

Me: Yeah. We checked in earlier this week. I think that's okay for right now. We'll obviously have to look together on toes. In the margins the next

Them: So

Me: days and early next week. But that's okay. Mhmm.

Them: you know how we've gone back or you've gone back and forth about how frequently to

Me: Yeah.

Them: meet with Dan, and because of various things, your next one on one is not till September 9\.

Me: Okay.

Them: Then after that, I think it's three weeks and then every two weeks. It was

Me: That's probably fine.

Them: I think because of some stuff going on, think part of it was we weren't sure if you were go like,

Me: Right. Yep. Exactly.

Them: originally, you were gonna be away in Ohio. Next week. So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: things got moved around. And he's doing I think he's got a pro professional development. He's got something

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: coming up that Maybe that was last month. I see it. It must I could've been confused. It might've been last month. But, anyway,

Me: I know he did have one last month, so maybe it was that.

Them: yeah. So just let me know if you do you think that that will be enough?

Me: I think it's probably fine I mean, he and I'll he and I'll have to just sort sort out how often we wanna meet about things in general. But as long as I've got something recurring, I think it's okay.

Them: Okay.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then how are things shaping up with Poe's writing? Do you have any sense

Me: I mean, I def I'll definitely need

Them: how much time you want set aside for that?

Me: some time early next week to to keep on digging in. I've I've gotten to it some today, and, you know, there's a lot that's already written. But know, but I'll need to focus on it for a couple you know, the equivalent of a couple solid days across the next you know, now into next week, next Thursday or so.

Them: Next week, you've got basically half days.

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: What I need to confirm is did everything change on the whole whole idea proposal ideation meetings.

Me: I'm we're not gonna do the virtual meetings this week, obviously.

Them: Because there's some reservations next week on the calendar.

Me: Yeah. It's still wanna do something Yeah. I think those can come off. But I still wanna do something early in September. So I I need to figure out what's happening.

Them: Okay.

Me: With that. Whether we do that overlapping with the first day Danielle is here on the second or otherwise. I'm not totally sure yet.

Them: Okay.

Me: But, yeah, we decided against launching the sort of full round of virtual conversations at the same time as you know, people were just realizing that there were NSF proposals to be put in. So I'm

Them: Yeah.

Me: having individual conversations with people as much as anything right now.

Them: Okay.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. So as I look forward, I think you've got you know, a few hours on Friday. It depends on how much work you're gonna have to do after the board meeting.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then basically, Tuesday, besides the strategy,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: session, you don't have any meetings. But you're also balancing getting the bullets done for the Valhalla report.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: So I've got almost all of Tuesday reserved and Wednesdays reserved. As well. You just have your meeting with Rick and Sue.

Me: Yeah. That's good.

Them: I'm guessing you're not gonna go to that MSU meeting

Me: No.

Them: on Wednesday. Yeah. So you will have some you have some flexibility, I think. And then there's

Me: Yep. Yeah. I think that's good.

Them: and there's pockets Your morning on Thursdays,

Me: Okay.

Them: is open. Thirty. So

Me: Yeah. That's good.

Them: did you finish your apples? That's Okay. Good. I think you've got water bottle then. I think you'll be able to use mostly work time.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You may have to do a little bit at night. But I

Me: Yeah. Yeah. It looks looks pretty reasonable if I can get a good start on it

Them: if you can yeah.

Me: the end of this week.

Them: So okay. Was there any follow\-up with David Sharon that you need to make sure you get into

Me: I got the one in that I needed to, which is following up with a potential

Them: or Karen?

Me: coach that he gave me a contact for, which is good. So

Them: Okay. Okay. Okay.

Me: other than that, I don't need to follow\-up on other stuff.

Them: Anything from Helen before the board meeting that you need to do?

Me: No.

Them: Okay. Are you gonna do slides? That's the other thing that I wasn't I had some time reserved, but

Me: That's a good question. Probably, if I can get away with not it'll be better. And it often doesn't make sense if I've only got one unless it's some document I'm sharing. So I would leave an hour in case I need to get stuff together, but I don't need

Them: Okay.

Me: four or five hours to make a slide deck or anything like that.

Them: Because you have a little time at the end of the day tomorrow, and you've got

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: Friday morning. Do you do you think it's worth meeting with the grants group I mean, I put a couple things on the agenda

Me: Yes. I do. I think it's worth meeting with them.

Them: I don't think things are quite resolved with the security

Me: Yeah. That's that was all Dan's work

Them: training.

Me: on a proposal that is new. Somebody and coming up soon, and I've got a post. So all those together are

Them: Okay. Is it is it a different pose?

Me: worth meeting about at the very least. It's a different it's a it's the computing education one that we talked about a while back when somebody else is doing it and we're sub on it.

Them: Okay.

Me: But it's due September 11 or something, so it's coming up fast.

Them: Is it with a university? Or

Me: Yeah. It's with with MSU, with our contact name Sue there.

Them: oh, okay. Okay.

Me: But that'll be on the radar screen because it's

Them: Yep.

Me: coming up quickly and probably is not on people's radar yet.

Them: Oh, is that the one someone contacted you and you put them in connect with Dan? Like, you and Dan responded. I think I'm remembering this.

Me: I don't think so. I think it's a different one because this is somebody that Dan knows.

Them: Oh,

Me: Who came up. You know, who we we know she's

Them: Okay.

Me: gotten other proposals of awarded at MSU, and she is hoping to parlay one of those relationships into

Them: Got it.

Me: one of these.

Them: Got it. Okay. We'll keep it on the calendar.

Me: Yeah. It's definitely worth worth having a conversation to talk about that. Mhmm.

Them: Just for your knowledge,

Me: Okay.

Them: all of them have been shortened to half an hour. But I'm sure in September and

Me: Yeah. Right. Yeah.

Them: maybe in October, the October, you'll need longer time. So I I'll take a guess and, know, make adjustments, but you guys will have to

Me: Yeah.

Them: come to some final determination about that.

Me: That that make that makes sense. Yep.

Them: And I don't know if you've looked recently If you wanna pull up here's the link, my sort of notes for everyone to think about. After I leave.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Scheduling thing that I really need to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: complete is Helen. Make sure that

Me: Okay.

Them: we at least have dates for you through the end of the year. And one of the decisions that we have to figure out what you prefer is the changes that happen, how I adjust the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: invitation list for the MDC meetings. I have a contact list you know, through my Google account, I think, as a delegate, I could put it in your contacts. And you could do it that way.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And, basically, when things bounce back, from invitations and it says, you know, I can determine they're no longer working there, or we get messages that, you know, I've changed jobs. Please take me

Me: Mhmm.

Them: off the list. What I would do is go into the contact list, make the adjustment And then depending on the timing of when the meeting is, I will either go into if the invitation's already been sent out, I will go and just

Me: Mhmm.

Them: take that person off. And then fix it on the, you know, when I upload the list, it will be

Me: Right.

Them: it will reflect the changes. So does that sound like is putting it in your contact the best way you wanna manage it? Do you have a

Me: I think that's probably probably and my guess

Them: another idea

Me: is it might be something that Kate would be good to manage as well. We she's comes on, you know, more often than not

Them: Mhmm.

Me: and knows a lot of people in the network.

Them: Yes.

Me: So, so finding way to to transfer that so that she also sees it or that it's mostly her responsibility. I'm happy to have to get that make that happen. It might mean that transferring it to me, and then I, you know, transfer it to her later on because she's away next week. But we

Them: Okay.

Me: probably do it via email too. Mhmm.

Them: I can always send an email to the two of you and say, this is what I've done.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I

Me: And and mostly, you're

Them: I think with contacts,

Me: saying you get occasional requests to the Google form that need to be added to the list.

Them: Yep.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And then responding to

Me: That's the that that right. Yeah.

Them: months backs and stuff. And

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I know with contacts, you can download a CSV file. That could be shared.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then I think

Me: Right.

Them: Kate could up

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: up could manage it from there. So that may be the way to go.

Me: Okay. Yeah. That would be

Them: Why don't I get that organized and ready, and then I'll send an email to the two of you.

Me: that would be good. Yeah. And getting the form

Them: Okay.

Me: the form link and the information, make sure the form is shared.

Them: Right.

Me: That sort of thing, I think, is what's important.

Them: Yeah. I think originally you were on it, and then we took you off. So I'll

Me: Right. Yeah. I don't know.

Them: yeah. I will add you to that. Should I add Kate to it?

Me: Yeah. I got Kate as well.

Them: Okay. And then One idea I had about your your recurring expenses. In row 15 is where I put some notes I thought I could try and test things out with Judy and just, like, start with Glowforge. And if I transfer it to accounts payable, and then she could then upload I think she might know or has access to the

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: card for Sue. And then then we could move If it works, then we could try it with a couple of the others. I think the trickiest one is the ChatGPT because it's

Me: Yeah.

Them: such a pain in the neck.

Me: Right.

Them: Pulling that down. But we'll see. And I'm gonna look up I hadn't remembered. I I know the MIT Tech Magazine. I think that's May because it was recent. Harvard Business

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Review is in the winter, and NSTAA is in the spring too. So I was going to make a note of the months for that renewal so they know you know when to look and if you get the email to forward it to Judy.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: What I was thinking about handling that one. And I put in the dates It's gonna be in April.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Neck, in 2026\. I don't know if you'd heard. It's gonna be out in Anaheim, So from my recollection, it's usually in September is when you have to submit presentations.

Me: Yeah. It's always changed, or it's changed more recently, but that's probably about right.

Them: So I added that into Omnifocus and deferred it. And then in the calendar in early September, I said, you know, check when NSTA presentations are due. So hopefully those are decent reminders. And Cynthia usually sends a blast out to everybody saying, hey, if you're going and you're gonna present, here's the deadline.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: So I'm thinking there those are three avenues to catch your

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: attention.

Me: Speaking virtually too, see if I can looks like my Minneapolis one. Came in a while back and

Them: Which what?

Me: the Minneapolis one

Them: Mini app, like a

Me: The there's a Minneapolis NSCA conference.

Them: a conference? Oh,

Me: This November. Mhmm.

Them: and it's not the annual conference?

Me: They have two annual conferences now.

Them: Oh, I think at one point, you had mentioned that to me.

Me: So, hopefully, I didn't miss that. Let's see. Let's see. Let's to figure out where the actual acceptance thing is.

Them: Was this for attendance or

Me: Proposal and presentations in my account to talk.

Them: to talk?

Me: So the process of presentation in my account. See. My account. Go to proposals and presentation.

Them: Call for proposals.

Me: Okay. There it is. Repulses and presentations. Got a little badge on it. Yeah. Okay.

Them: I think it I think it was supposed

Me: Yes. I got three accepted. That's good.

Them: oh, you already submitted them.

Me: Yeah. No. No. That's a confirmed May. Oh, submitted May. Yes. November. Yes. For the for NSCA in November in Minneapolis.

Them: Minneapolis. Okay.

Me: So

Them: So you're planning to go?

Me: yeah. Because I'll be able to visit my dad, and one of the two national ones. They don't have it in Minnesota very often.

Them: And

Me: Yeah.

Them: then you don't have to go across to California, which is always challenging with the time required.

Me: Right. Exactly. Alright. Okay. We'll have to confirm those. It takes a minute to go through the agree that I'm not using the lay live animals or flames, but good. I'm glad

Them: That is such a funny requirement, but I suppose with biology or chemistry you might be.

Me: yeah. It's a science thing. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Anyway, sorry. Mean to sidetrack us, but

Them: That's okay.

Me: I've been wondering about that.

Them: I'm gonna I'm putting it in the calendar for you.

Me: Yeah. November 14 thirteenth and fourteenth. I'm good. They're not on the last day either.

Them: Oh, how nice for you.

Me: This means

Them: You've been on the last day for a couple times.

Me: Yeah. I mean, it might actually get people attending, which may not

Them: Oh, it's already in here.

Me: NCA is in there, but my presentations, still have to put in.

Them: You would okay. Okay. One thing that and maybe I'll put it in Omnifocus. One thing that you maybe we should put it as recurring is just to make sure that you without me prompting, you need to make sure that you're talking to Liz to determine your car pickup Because there are sometimes

Me: Right. Yes.

Them: some appointments, some meetings that are already scheduled across that. Sometimes you have a BEKA meeting at that slot,

Me: Yeah.

Them: that you will wanna you know, try to get coverage so that you can keep but he he may have to move. Back up. But just make sure you have that conversation every couple of weeks so you can look through your calendar.

Me: Yeah. We know we definitely will. We have to do it, on a regular basis. Because we're always coordinating the beginning of the week, but I may be to lock something in that's a little bit more solid. So it even easier.

Them: And it doesn't always transfer back. That's the thing that you've gotta come up with some hack.

Me: Right.

Them: So it gets back in your calendar.

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: Hey, Cora. I'm on a call, sweetie. Have a have a have a good session. K. And one of the things that Judy said that she indicated would be helpful is you know, going through my job description.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Although my job description

Me: May or may not be useful. Right. Exactly.

Them: is rather vague Like, I think it's been very fine tuned as you and I have worked together.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I put in my notes, it's at the bottom of that page, It's I indicated who I think is gonna be supporting or helping you with it. Yeah. You know, I think the notes and keeping track of projects. Are you still using Granola?

Me: Yes.

Them: Okay. So I think that'll be helpful.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. It is. And I'm playing with AI stuff in the background, getting some workflows and things. I've got Granola putting notes into Evernote for me now, and I've gotten testing out some workflows that can automate

Them: Okay.

Me: things a little bit better. So that should help as well.

Them: Okay. If you know, I'm I'm guessing that Lisa and Cynthia will be the most productive and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and working with you to move proposals forward? I think the challenge for you without someone proactively managing how you spend your time is you know, is that piece of making sure you're

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: not overpromising and underestimating your writing time.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Exactly.

Them: Because I think I those are the two things that can trip you up without you know, the grants team

Me: Mhmm.

Them: being in regular communication about that kind of stuff.

Me: Yeah. No. I think that's I think that's true.

Them: So

Me: That and and figuring out how to do some sane version of scheduling that keeps the management in place without my over, you know, overpromising slots or availability. And that's, I think, the because I can I can figure out how to you know, schedule actually make events and calendar events pretty easily? But in the moment, it's easy to miss that I just gave away a bunch of time that I have given away or what have you. I mean, that's that's sort of metamangement of, like, yeah, you could meet you know, with everybody next Thursday, but

Them: Mhmm.

Me: on Friday, you've got something due. So you shouldn't you know, give that time away. And

Them: I could do what I often do, which is basically the two weeks leading up to a proposal submission I block out time

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so people can't schedule anything. And I'll either put writing or deep work or just if we know the name of the proposal, I'll put that in and maybe that could be a queue.

Me: Mean, I think that's a good starting point. That's a good way to transfer some of the knowledge, at least for the proposal pieces, like, to recognize that CORE, RITEL, DRK 12 are all coming up and I'll be working on something for each of those. Either it's mine or somebody else's or what have you. And so just imagining I have a proposal for each one of those three and blocking out time, generically, I think, would be useful. And then

Them: And I can look and see if I can get back to know, since

Me: Mhmm.

Them: get back to allocating two days where you have

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: zero or only one meeting. You know, adding the multiple meetings with Sue and Rick and that type of thing has hampered that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you're gonna need to add Danielle and

Me: Right.

Them: but I I think I mean, I I can at least do that where I'm blocking off time. That I mean, that would probably be my

Me: Mhmm.

Them: my most fervent suggestion or plea.

Me: Yes.

Them: Try to keep two days or three quarter days on two days.

Me: Right.

Them: Where you don't have meat. Don't say yes to everything.

Me: Exactly. That's the

Them: And And I can add this to the notes. Remember that

Me: thing I need to to do is

Them: you unless it's about a proposal with a deadline or somebody's like, hey. You know, we need you to sign a contract right now.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: To use your stuff or license it or whatever. The you know, generally, your calendar is booked three weeks. Two weeks out, sometimes three weeks out depending on how busy you are.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And even though it may not be full of colored blocks, It's full in the sense that if you were to full every you know, fill everything from a you know, eleven to

Me: Right.

Them: five, you don't have any time to do anything else. So

Me: Exactly.

Them: that's why keeping a week two to three week lead time

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, unless it's urgent and you know, like, yeah. We've gotta do this. And you do. You generally do. You'd be like, yeah. We need this this week, Sarah. But I think keeping that in the back of your mind and

Me: Right.

Them: sharing with some people internally. I mean, maybe at core support you set out some guidelines and say if you're gonna be putting on a meeting putting a meeting on my calendar, you know, please remember that if I've got four meetings already scheduled on a meeting on a day, don't schedule anymore.

Me: I think I I think I'll need to right. I think I'll need to

Them: Unless it's absolutely urgent.

Me: to find ways to make, you know, available blocks or appointment blocks or something so that I'm because the there are two functions, I think, you disappear when there's not a sort of an intermediary. One of them is just the the sort of thinking filter there about, wait. We you know, just because there's a blank spot on the calendar doesn't mean that it should be given up. And and the the second person effective, my being able to say, oh, and so and we'll handle that. And then there's some possible deniability because, you know, I had to cancel some other meeting or whatever. Like, it

Them: Yeah.

Me: I'm not in the front lines of the reason that that thing got canceled, and and both of those, you know, changed. So I need to bring back some of them and create, you know, thick skin for other parts of them. But it may be that, you know, I've got big blocks of time when you can schedule meetings with me, but rest of it, you just can't or something like that because I can't go back to and I've already started to have people say, like, oh, can I schedule that know, on the calendar? And like, I can't go back to, like, you just schedule anything anywhere

Them: Yeah.

Me: you're in the company with me.

Them: That yeah. That

Me: And, you know, that that

Them: I think would

Me: exactly. Yeah. So

Them: hurt everyone in the long run. I I really think so. And so well, I'll try and do what I can to set that up so you have it least two days with almost no meetings. And then

Me: Yeah. I think that'd be useful. Right?

Them: and you know, the other thing is

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and I've done this sometimes is that morning time extended on certain days.

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: So that no beats steals that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So okay. When you look at sort of who else would be sort of partnering with you on these responsibilities that are listed in the admin job description. Just scan that quickly at the bottom of the sheet and see if there's anything you want any text you wanna add, any notes you wanna add, ideas that you're gonna try, I think that what's probably not listed here the row above, that you're in, the assistant CEO and proposal development. What's not there that since we've had Jira, we we have a system for, which is if you do a presentation or a talk, that it gets added to the website. So I think

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, maybe having a formal conversation with Cynthia saying, you know, can you take the lead on this going forward?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And that way it will

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: still be done. And, I mean, the great thing about it is it it helps capture

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the work that you've done to create the presentation. Because I know sometimes you'll go back to those things or other people will say, oh, just can't, you know,

Me: Right.

Them: did Chad ever write something about this? Or didn't he do a presentation on

Me: Mhmm.

Them: x, y, and z?

Me: Yeah. No. That's a good example of the the little things that are smaller grain size than this

Them: Yeah.

Me: description, but that should get captured somehow. So maybe that's a whole separate list of brain dump of stuff or maybe it or maybe it's notes in with these. I'm not sure. But

Them: Well, I Sue and Cynthia wanted to have

Me: Yeah.

Them: a chance to view this afterwards. I get a get the sense that they're

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, the three of you may do some brainstorming.

Me: These are from the job description. Is that right?

Them: Yep.

Me: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just

Them: Which I mean, it's

Me: is fine, but it's but it's general is what I'm saying.

Them: it's fairly accurate but it was very broad and

Me: Exactly. So that that's where I feel like, you know and maybe another cheat in here too or but that you a brain dump or transfer one from one you already have because I know you were looking at that before of a more granular set of things. That'd be really useful for me as well because I may find that some of those, you know, granular things I can you know, I could partially automate and hand off to somebody. Some of those are ones that if I recognize them, I may have a different take on how to describe them to somebody. And I'm not quite sure what those

Them: I start that's what I started on the upper part And I think what I'll do is you know, certain notes, like under calendar, I will make some notes about sort of how I structure things so that maybe those can be the more granular notations.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. I don't know how many of those sort of brained up notes there are, but it feels like that you know, the the equivalent of the notes that you put together for my time sheet, were, like, what are the

Them: I think what's tough right.

Me: the, like, twenty, thirty minute tasks or things that get forgotten because you just sort of do them. Right? But they're

Them: Yeah. Well and the thing that fluctuates you know, I mean, from day one, you know, scheduling and calendar management has been anywhere from it's been anywhere from 50% to 80% of my job some weeks. Depending on what's going on with

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: external partnerships. You know, are you more internally focused with proposals, or are you more externally focused on sort of, okay, we're gonna get going on the next round of proposals and I need to meet with people or people have contacted you, or you've gone to a conference. And, you know, you met someone who you need to connect with and so my bet is that if if I can reserve half days or three quarter days to writing or work,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: outside of meetings. I mean, worst case scenario, you could set those up as a test and say, well, I'm gonna do three hours two days a week. And do it as a test, either way people you could say to people, you know, Google appointments can be you know, you can make

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: make an appointment on Google appointments or do Calendly. The trick is when, obviously,

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: as we talked about, when you have more than one person involved.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah. I'm looking a little bit into whether there are other ways to to manage that piece. But, you know, but somehow it's gotta be clear that there are only certain blocks and that they're not any of it is not arbitrarily schedule except if I set the the guidelines for you could schedule within a certain block.

Them: There may be

Me: Because

Them: on the as I'm thinking this through, I don't know if it's a premium version of Calendly, but I am I it I don't think it's multiple people. I think it only added one. I know sometimes with with Zarek, I have been able to I set time up for the two of you and there's an opportunity to add somebody else So I would add my own names so I would make sure that I would get updates and things to it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So I don't know if a competitor of Calendly has an even better option for that.

Me: Possibly. Yeah. I'm not sure.

Them: Right. I think you starting at least with you know, even if you did, six hours of a week, of this is when I'm gonna do meetings,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The question is, you have to or not the question. The the thing you have to consider is is it going to be those six hours are available for people outside of Concord?

Me: Right.

Them: Or, like, how do you work in

Me: Yeah. No. I'm not I'm yeah. I'm telling Lee I mean, my guess is currently won't work as a single option, and that may be this downfall anyway because know, I've often have meetings that are more than one person whatever you and the Calendly is really meant for one on one as far I mean, I haven't looked into it in\-depth, but I think it's problematic that way.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And so I think I think that process that you that you use is sending you know, sending potential slots to people and seeing what say yes to, especially if it sounds like that works for you 80, 90% of the time. And then identifying a point person at the other organization to be the one who can say yes for a group of people or something like that.

Them: That that's ideal.

Me: And then making a regular calendar event and scheduling them into it. I mean, I think that's the the process.

Them: Know? And as I scan ahead, you know, I would either do Tuesdays and Thursdays or

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Tuesdays and Wednesdays. As sort of reserving time for you to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: do work. Thursdays would sometimes end up being only half a day because of you know, c four, all hands, and that kind of thing. So I and if you're managing things in such a way where you can dip into some morning time, at least for people on East Coast and and Central Time. You could it's know, you could identify sort of a batch of, you know, a three hour block one morning and a three hour block in the afternoon. On two days, each week and you could say, I try to keep my meetings to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: these thing these time slots.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: You know, the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the thing with the other thing is to blow it all up and reconstruct it the way you want. And say, okay. On, you know, Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon from 12:00 on is when I'll I'll have external meetings.

Me: Right. And to some degree, I'm gonna have to do that because you know, I'm gonna it's school year starting, and, you know, probably have probably have to drive more now than we've had to. So I'm I already

Them: Mhmm.

Me: was just we were talking adjusting those to make sure that they met the match the school schedule and may have to make them longer because sometimes, you know, really, it stays after. So not quite sure what that will do, but it'll be one version of re of blowing it up

Them: Yeah.

Me: to and if I can do that in conjunction with having available slots people have some flexibility with I think it might you know, help avoid the the issues. Yeah. I mean, people get trained into things. So if I can have solid chunks of consistent days available or like that, then people start to learn that Wednesday afternoon is a good time or something like that.

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right. One of the things that can always be tricky is if the proposal deadline is one where all of your you've had to chain you know, clear your schedule.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then some people you will need to reschedule right away, but others, like,

Me: Right. And then all piles up. Right. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: oh, no. We'll meet in another week.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Does it we didn't say it. Wanna double check. Is there anything on that spreadsheet about sort of job description stuff that you think we should note that I haven't added?

Me: Just a sec. It's playing with Let's So just before I look at that, can you look at I just made a test appointment thing at 6PM tonight. I'm trying to figure out how it works with cohosts. You probably don't see that on your calendar, but do you see it on

Them: Let's see.

Me: my calendar? It's called test.

Them: Hold on. For what day?

Me: To the twentieth tonight.

Them: There's oh, there it is. Yeah. 6PM. And then I got a bunch of emails

Me: Yep. So okay, What and what what did those say?

Them: That's weird. Oh, alright.

Me: Yeah. I made those.

Them: You have three different things in Minnesota. Right? That's why. Okay.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Old weekly.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I met I moved a bunch of other

Them: Yep.

Me: stuff around, so that was different. But this test one is the one that I'm looking at.

Them: It just says hold weekly from three to four.

Me: Now look at maybe just look at my calendar at

Them: At the calendar.

Me: PM tonight.

Them: Open booking page.

Me: And see if you see the test see if you see test. Okay.

Them: So if I open the booking cape page, Yeah. That's how you can set up your availability on Google.

Me: Yeah. But right. But I what I'm interested in is that I made you a cohost on that. And I can you can add 20 cohosts. So I'm wondering if that's a way to allow multiple people to book a single slot. Because what I don't know is well, if you Yeah, I guess I need to check with somebody else too. But if you add yourself to one of those, what it looks like,

Them: Well,

Me: Can you book a slot in there?

Them: I don't think I can because you've at well, well, it says me see. There's no availability. One when I look at your calendar, So it says booking form.

Me: Oh,

Them: So it says test 6PM.

Me: oh,

Them: Bookable appointment schedule,

Me: okay. Yeah. Sorry. I I think I here. I moved it to

Them: I think if you set those up,

Me: to the next day, Thursday at four. It was out of work outside of work hours, I think.

Them: Oh,

Me: Although yeah. And I think I'm not busy at that four. So maybe maybe it changes it now if you try to book

Them: Yes.

Me: book. Okay.

Them: Yes. So now it comes up as options four, 04:15, 04:30, 04:45\. So

Me: Okay. Yeah. So try that.

Them: I can book 04:15\. I just booked it.

Me: Okay.

Them: And see what comes up for you.

Me: And let me see.

Them: And I what happens is I get an email saying, you have a new appointment back.

Me: Yes. So I see four of

Them: Booked with Chad,

Me: thirty, 04:45, open. Let's see what others see. Interesting. Okay.

Them: So what shows up is your bookable slots, which you set for the entire hour.

Me: Right. What I don't know is if

Them: Are

Me: somebody else who's a cohost goes in do they see ability to book at 04:15 as well? That was what I was wondering because you can add 20 cohosts. So I'm wondering if there's some way to make everybody a cohost for everything everything. And then they can add themselves to a slot at a time.

Them: Are you

Me: Because right now, I think it just yeah. I'm thinking

Them: thinking of this for internal stuff? Are you thinking about this when you have to schedule

Me: I'm thinking Sue I'm thinking Sue and Judy say, can we meet? And I'm like, yeah. You guys schedule a time sometime in my Monday slot. And if they could both go in and choose four to four thirty, on Monday, then it would be great. But

Them: Yeah.

Me: the problem is typical mode is Sue chooses 04:00, and then it's not available for Judy.

Them: But can you

Me: Can you add somebody to that 04:15 slot?

Them: I'm gonna see. I just added Judy. And I can send it to her.

Me: Oh, interesting.

Them: So I went into the 04:15 slot,

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: and she was accepted. She's now do you when you go to it, do you see the 04:15 where it's a calendar event where

Me: I still haven't figured out what I see because so far, it just says

Them: well, just go to your

Me: test for me. Yeah.

Them: first and open that calendar event for 04/15\. Do

Me: Weird thing oh, there it is. I see it was being covered over.

Them: do you see

Me: Yes. So I see you and Judy and Sue. Uh\-huh. And you did not add Sue. Is that right?

Them: I did not. You did.

Me: Okay.

Them: So then I I was able to add Judy.

Me: No. I didn't. I I only I added Sue as a co I added you and Sue as cohost to see what cohost did. Okay.

Them: I think it's what allows

Me: So let me try

Them: Sue or me to add people.

Me: Yeah. So let me try this again. So I'm going to I'm gonna delete that whole thing. And then oh, let me delete the appointments. That's interesting. K. And now I'm gonna add again and call it new test actually. Change the time to 04:00\. We test appointment schedule. Okay. Fifteen minutes. Okay. So now there's spot in that same thing called new test. But you're not a cohost. If you choose 04:15 on that, can you add somebody

Them: Need to refresh. Did you take the original event and just

Me: No. I deleted the whole

Them: change it, or did you create a new event?

Me: thing and made a new one called new test. That's my appointment schedule.

Them: It says appointment not found. May have been deleted.

Me: If you go on to my calendar, do you see that new test appointment option?

Them: Or may be incorrect. Yep. Confession for the last six years.

Me: I know.

Them: I live in your calendar. It's always open, Chad.

Me: You totally see it. I'm sure.

Them: Yeah. So I see the availability but when it says it because what happens is when you when you send when you add

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Sue and me, we then get a message that says open booking page.

Me: Right.

Them: Or you can share it

Me: Mhmm.

Them: what does this do? But when I open first, let me say that if I open the booking page, it tells me that nothing is no appointment is found.

Me: On the new test one. Okay. I'm gonna delete this entire

Them: Yep. But let me see what happens when you hit share.

Me: k. I'm gonna add a new one. A totally different time.

Them: Oh, it would it's would allow allows you to share the fact that people can book appointments. That's all that is.

Me: K. So appointment schedule that week. Alright. Good. Continue. Just not repeat. Fifteen minutes. Oh, desk invite others is an actually. Okay. Great. So so if you go to next Thursday, the twenty eighth, At 11AM,

Them: Yep. Hold on. Okay. Open booking page. It's saying oh, wait a minute. There. Okay. Yes. It's giving me fifteen minute blocks to choose from.

Me: Okay. And if you book one, can you confirm that you could invite Sue to that one once you are done?

Them: Let me look.

Me: Because if so, then that might be the answer. I see it show up.

Them: Well, right now, I don't know if I can add people because I'm a double

Me: No, you're not on this. Oh,

Them: Yeah.

Me: from my calendar, you mean? Interesting.

Them: Okay. I'm adding Sue. Yeah. So I could add Sue, but I don't know how much of

Me: I think I think it's actually okay.

Them: is that because I can I can be you

Me: I had the I checked the box that said, guest can invite others. There was one in the appointment setup.

Them: Oh,

Me: So I think it's a generic phone permission So if that's the case, then that might be really helpful arrow in the quiver. Because that would mean I could set up

Them: Yep?

Me: office hours and make them half hour slots And I could just say to Sue and Judy, you know, I've got Monday afternoon. I've got some some time you know, book a slot then.

Them: Yep.

Me: And Judy could book it and add Sue and call it done. I don't know if they can

Them: Yep.

Me: change the name of it. It'd be really nice if they could do that. But but either way, it would let me give open control gated open control to people who have access to my calendar. Internally.

Them: Right. Yeah.

Me: And, potentially, it's you know, it might even be a Calendly ish

Them: Mhmm.

Me: kind of thing as well. I might be able to open that up to others and say, oh, okay. I've got a you know, open meeting slots time choose the time within this and let them run point the same way.

Them: Right. Right. Like, if you you know, you could do that with Cambium or WestEd and

Me: Right.

Them: yeah.

Me: Mhmm. Because that's the only way. I think there's sanity in

Them: I think that

Me: is that if I you know, if I'm like, okay. Monday afternoons, you know, shot with meetings, but Tuesday morning, I've got time.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And because already, you know, Kylie was booking something the other day or know, all this, you know, Danielle. She's like, can I book an onboarding prep with Danielle? I'm like, yeah. That's great. But it's, like, smack in the middle of my

Them: Right.

Me: post writing and budget time. So, like, great.

Them: Yeah.

Me: But great. You know?

Them: Yeah. Like, if she had sent it to me,

Me: Right.

Them: I mean, I am still here and working.

Me: Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: She could I could have said,

Me: Well, like, I sort of did it as a test to sort of to try this out.

Them: okay.

Me: I'm like, occasionally, I'm like, okay. Yeah. Just like, I'm like, okay. What would I say in this instance, and what would happen if I said that in this instance?

Them: Right.

Me: Like, what how does this turn out? Just to uncover some of those scenarios.

Them: M like, Sue booked a time for you and Judy and her I think it's it's FTE review. So I think it's looking at

Me: Yep. Well and that and that she checked with me, and I

Them: okay. So

Me: said, okay. Can we do it right before or right after?

Them: yes. Okay. Okay.

Me: Was good. But, you know, I have to spend fifteen minutes thinking about that too. So minimizing yeah, that too would be nice.

Them: Because I try

Me: Yeah.

Them: whenever I can is to

Me: Mhmm. Exactly.

Them: lock things. So that you have bigger open slots whenever we can manage it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Like, I would have said can we do it right after the post budget meeting?

Me: Right.

Them: Have Danielle then

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and then the FTE FTE review right after that. So the remainder of the afternoon, you could be working on Pose.

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: Undisturbed.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Or ballet.

Me: Yeah. And I think the thing that I need to do within it is you know, understand how much of that suggestion that you make is suggesting things that require the people to reschedule stuff versus is it always looking at whatever open slots are available and suggesting. Right? I mean, that's that's the the line to to walk there. I mean, I could always say, well, I'm available 12:45 on Monday and no other time, and everybody else has to move their meetings. You know, or I could chase the calendar around, you know, and always do things when people are available and have Swiss cheese on my calendar. Right. Exactly.

Them: You can't you that's what you were dealing with before. You

Me: Exactly. Yeah.

Them: you had someone.

Me: Right.

Them: To help you, and you

Me: So I need to find I need to find a way to

Them: don't want to go back to that.

Me: no way. Exactly.

Them: It drives everybody else crazy, and you could not work well.

Me: Yeah. Exactly. So I need to to find some ways to to corral that. And probably this appointment mode is the fur the best first pass at it.

Them: I agree.

Me: And maybe that I mean, I could make that I could bite the bullet and make that widely available for a few weeks so that people get used to it. And I recognize that I'm gonna have a bunch of meetings, but, you know, I'm doing it at the gain of people training themselves that that's how they schedule meetings with me. And then guess what? I've got proposal week, and I only have two appointment

Them: Right.

Me: slots or something like that.

Them: And you can I like, like we've always done when we've tested new processes is you check\-in and in a month? Like, okay. What what do we need to adjust?

Me: Right. Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: You know, oh, these happen to be happening more on you know, Tuesdays because everybody thinks about what they need on Monday.

Me: Right.

Them: And Fridays or something. So I had Daniel onboarding in September, not August 25\. Has that changed?

Me: That that's a planning meeting for the onboarding.

Them: Oh, that's what it is. That's oh, that's right. That's right. Yep.

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: So and, I mean, eventually, that twenty fifth will open up a little bit once that schedule is set because you're only gonna meet with her for a portion of the day. You're not meeting with her all day.

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: So, You know, because you know, following you know, pose two, it's gonna be any work you have to do for the Spencer Foundation for whatever support you're giving Dan for

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the education one. I don't know what the you didn't say what the exact name is. You know? And then I don't know if anybody is doing ECR core Like, you've got as basically from now until November, I think you need to you're gonna have to be very strict about

Me: Right.

Them: boundaries.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And

Me: Yep.

Them: not everybody has needed this, but Sue was the only one who said, Can I have my meeting with Chad on Thursday or Friday instead at the beginning of the week?

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Everyone else, I think, it can be flexible. So

Me: Yeah. I think so. I just need to figure out what my options are for. Guess I can always, I guess I can put a hold potential appointment schedule. I'm thinking about the times when I wanna have a buffer, like, in to open up when nobody fits into that particular appointment schedule, but I don't want to have five opened know, blocks that week. I may need to I I guess if I have hold times, that I know are potentially openable for appointments, I could turn one of those into an appointment schedule during the week or something.

Them: And now that you say that, that would be a trick I would sometimes use. Because if I would sometimes schedule six slots you know, of three hours or more across

Me: Mhmm.

Them: two or three weeks, I would use some of those slots for partner meetings as proposal development

Me: Mhmm.

Them: is moving along, that it's not just

Me: Right.

Them: you sitting and writing out a proposal. There's other pieces to the proposal. And that is when that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: those tasks can get done. So I think that's the other thing to keep in mind as you use

Me: Mhmm.

Them: free or busy time.

Me: Right. Yeah. You know, if you were to describe the the unspoken, this is tacit knowledge stuff, if you were to describe the unspoken rules that you used when you are making calendar events or changing them around? I mean, have we described it? What what what if you listen three or four, what are they? I mean, it sounds like blocking things together is one.

Them: Blocking things together. Pushing back and saying no and say he's got this and this. Is you know, is this urgent where I need to move things around, or can it wait for ten days or know, next week? It's I would I would actually try to be as generous and try to give as give more free time for work on a proposal than you would tell me sometimes.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Like, I would try and walk off those deep work times you know, sometimes two to three weeks beforehand. So there's that. I am blocking your stuff so that you I could find at least two days where you had zero or only one meeting. Those are the things

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: you know, and maybe that means you know, Grant has moved to Thursday. And Sue has moved to Thursdays. So that Friday is and there's a lot of people on the staff who do this. Dan keeps Friday open

Me: Yep.

Them: Kate keeps Friday open.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I think Jay might. So it it would provide some synergy in terms of suddenly come something comes up, you you'd sort of have in the back of your mind. There's a bunch of us who try to get work done on Friday. So if something came up, you could

Me: Mhmm.

Them: allocate time for that. You know,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that's one of the things I could do to be helpful is just sort of be brutal about you know, moving

Me: Right. Yeah. That, I think, is the biggest one because that's I'm not as scared

Them: a few people And sometimes I would do that, sometimes I would move Granola,

Me: that. Mhmm.

Them: to Wednesdays if other things were happening. So that has moved in the past.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: So

Me: What percentage of the of the instance of instances are ones where you knew other people had to reschedule things? You know, of internal staff and you I mean, does that

Them: I would say it's very low.

Me: relatively rare? Or okay.

Them: It's very low. It's usually Leslie.

Me: That's good to know. Mhmm.

Them: And I would just send her a Slack and say, you know, you're meeting with Ethan for thirty minutes. Can I steal fifteen minutes? Or is it possible for you to reschedule so I can use it for this meeting with

Me: But most of the time, the pattern is

Them: WestEd or whoever?

Me: find a mutually open find a set of mutually open slots for the people who are attending and then optimize the the chosen slot so that it

Them: Yes.

Me: doesn't so that blocks bunches meetings together and leaves as much open space as possible and avoids days that are intended to be meeting low or meeting free.

Them: Yes.

Me: That's very useful.

Them: And I mean, the thing that I was you know, you you get a decent system, and then all of a sudden, like, oh, you know, we need we need to add something with multiple people.

Me: Right.

Them: Like,

Me: Exactly.

Them: there was a period of time where we were figuring out projects are ending, what kind of of coverage. So there was a lot of me there were monthly meetings added in 2024 for coverage and staffing conversations. And then the project budget review just for your

Me: Mhmm.

Them: projects. But that's now that particular one is down back to quarterly.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But it's the kind of thing where that's when you can sometimes have a little wrench, not a big one, but a little wrench where you're once you're putting more than three people together in a meeting at Concord, it gets to be hairy.

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Interesting. Well, I think that's all very useful. And together with the appointment thing, think there may be some opportunities there.

Them: I'm sort of scanning. It was not quite as busy as Leslie. Sue has the most meetings on Tuesdays. But then Friday, she has some monthly and biweekly meetings. But Wednesdays are her most open day.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Mondays and Wednesdays are her most open day. And the other thing that can be tricky although he's gotten better at it, is Dan would sometimes just put his calendar stuff on the all day section.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And this is the thing you have to remember. Depending on how the meeting is scheduled, you don't

Me: Right.

Them: always see all day items.

Me: Exactly.

Them: If you are on the front page of the calendar and you plug in their name, you will see their all day item. If you click create, and create an event, and add in names, you will not see all day items there.

Me: So the trick is to do the

Them: So I often you know, I'm looking at calendars in two ways every time I make a meeting. I have to check under on the front page, that column on the left, it says meet with.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You plug in their name there and then you'll see okay. You know, they're They're they have some all day, like, sometimes PD sessions will be put up there. Sometimes vacation will

Me: Mhmm.

Them: be put up there. So I always check that finding times, then I go in and create the event. And there's also that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that issue where although I think it's gotten better, because I haven't heard about it in a long time where Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Outlook If somebody external was using Microsoft Outlook, and invited someone from Concord with our Google Suite, If they said yes, it would not show up in the calendar that is shown to others. This used to happen with Leslie in DESE. And we did this whole I did this whole testing session with who was the company we used before, inserts?

Me: Uh\-huh. Yep.

Them: With Dan Lee? So, I mean, he and I spent a whole afternoon on and off testing various things. He did a bunch of research, There was no way to fix it. So I had to reach out to Leslie and say and he sent a note saying, please remember that

Me: Right.

Them: they don't always talk well. Don't handshake well. So that's the other thing. I I haven't run into it before, and I sometimes would run into it with Chris Mannnows. But now that he's not at Tufts and he's fully retired and only using Google, we haven't run into this. So sometimes with corporations,

Me: Right.

Them: will ask if they use Microsoft Teams or Google. But it hasn't it hasn't it affects more it affects meetings more when we're
