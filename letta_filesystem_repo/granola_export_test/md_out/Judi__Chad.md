Transcript:

Me: Hello, Judi.

Them: How are you?

Me: Okay. Yeah.

Them: Multitasking a zillion things here.

Me: Oh, yeah. No. I understand.

Them: So I have I have a whole list Some of it we already talked about, but I just as as things come on during the week, I just

Me: Yeah.

Them: throw them here to make

Me: That that's a good plan.

Them: sure Otherwise, they get lost in

Me: Yep.

Them: you know, shuffle. So, Intune, I know we kinda put it on hold for a while.

Me: Yeah. Have we seen that it's been valuable for people who have it?

Them: I I what I think where I think it's valuable

Me: Mhmm.

Them: is that we don't have really clear inventory right now. And I think that would be a way of us gathering inventory information

Me: Mhmm.

Them: without us having to say, hey.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Brian didn't leave us really good records, and we don't know what we have.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: I think it would make sense to roll it out. Think what we're doing now is as we add new purchases, we're adding them to Intune.

Me: Moobs are

Them: I think rolling it out after September 1 for the people that are left

Me: Yep. I think that's fine.

Them: Makes sense.

Me: Yep. I think I think it's fine. It hasn't caused me issues, and I've done a lot of stuff on my computer. And and as long as it's long as we're using it effectively in some way, shape or form, I think it's good

Them: So I'll talk to Laurel. I will

Me: So, yeah. I've I've got the message, and I'll

Them: plan to roll it out sometime mid September.

Me: write Right.

Them: So we'll plan to do that. And that way, we can get some clear inventory information because soon I need that because we need to figure out

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: replacement stuff Because right now, we're doing it on an as needed, and that's not a great way to you know, could put ourselves in a position where 10 max crash at once.

Me: Right. Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: Alright. So I'll say yes after nine one. We'll do that. Internet speed for the cottage. Sue really needs you to

Me: Yeah. What are I was just it's a note on my list. And I didn't have the options or the the info

Them: I don't have that, but I will have

Me: that we can ask her yesterday. Okay.

Them: Sue I will Slack Sue and say,

Me: Alright. I'll I'll stop her.

Them: and turn that

Me: Oh, I'm slacking away now too. Yeah I'm in Slacker right now.

Them: Alright. Yes. If you Slack her right now, then I know when you meet with her later, you two can resolve it. Because we wanna get that moving in case we need to have something done.

Me: Yeah.

Them: I had one more thing I wanna put on here before I forget. Okay. So, volunteers, I have to say this whole thing with Cynthia and Core.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I totally threw me. Totally threw me.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I have no idea who this NAT person is, Nate person, whatever.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: I did not write any agreement. That is certainly not

Me: Mhmm.

Them: any kind of an agreement I would have written I don't know who wrote it with Lynn. I don't know. What it says.

Me: Right. Yeah. I don't know and I don't know anything about it either. Yeah.

Them: I don't know anything. It totally freaked me out the other day. Like, what? We can't do that. And what do you mean Sarah Havin thinks she's gonna do on the project after she leaves?

Me: Right.

Them: So I just so you know, and I I said I will meet with Sue about this too, but I had my exit meeting with Sarah yesterday.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And she started talking about, well, you know, I said, well, you know, do you have plans? Whatever. She said, oh, well, you know, I have all these things I wanna do on the project. I said, you kinda work on the project after you leave.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Well, I'm volunteering, blah blah blah. I said, uh\-uh. I said, I I said, no. I you know, in my eyes, you can't volunteer. So I was not going to get into a big discussion with her because

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: there's no policy I can cite to her. But we, you know, I talked to Sue about it because I don't I don't believe everything

Me: Right.

Them: has to a big core discussion that doesn't get re

Me: Yeah. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: I did my research. Chad, GPT and I had many discussions about this.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Till I got the clear, concise, whatever. I have a document that has two tabs, one with the final summary of why former employees cannot be volunteers.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then all the backup from all my discussions with Chad, I just copied and pasted, so all the backup is there.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But she cannot volunteer on Lynn's project

Me: Mhmm.

Them: in any shape shape or form. She can't do data analysis. I mean, you can have someone volunteer and do something that's not part of normal project work.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But data analysis is normal project work on every project.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: You know, if you have something very to a very specific project, that is not the normal work of a project,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you could have a volunteer do that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But not if it's something in the scope of the project.

Me: Right.

Them: You know, you you know, my it's funny because my document you know, is basically you know, one is legal risk of of IRS risks. You could possibly lose your nonprofit status.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The IRS can come in and say, woah. You've misclassified that person. You owe them back wages.

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: And and pay pen penalties and taxes and whatever.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You risk your grant your grants because the the the funding organizations can say, wait a minute. You know, you you're screwing around with not paying people when you should.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The former employee is risking their unemployment

Me: Right.

Them: because you know, You know? And then equity and ethical, and then, you know, there's liability stuff

Me: Mhmm.

Them: all over. So, basically, what what we came up with is I have a very I'll just this is I this was so clear. Let me see if I can copy this and just put it in the chat for you. I was very it it took a lot of massaging to get here. A lot of massaging. But this was my final this was my final my final, like, three sentences.

Me: I think that's I think that's good and and probably could even be, more concise than that so that it's even less ambiguous. So I'm with you entirely. Mhmm.

Them: I mean, that's the bottom line. I mean, I have the the key reasons. I have a whole

Me: Yep.

Them: paragraph and my one, two, three, four, five bullets with key reasons

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: above it. But that was the bottom line. I mean,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so I'll talk to Sue about how we're gonna address this with Sarah and Lynn.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But I mean, what I can't tell you how much that conversation that

Me: Yeah.

Them: Cynthia had. Like, like, what? What? And then, you know, I said to Sue the other day, Carolyn is just the gift that just

Me: Yeah.

Them: keeps on giving. Alright. She does still have her email. We haven't stopped it. I think that

Me: Yeah. I mean and and I was

Them: she doesn't have access to it, but it's still there.

Me: right. So I I I was fine with that for the you know, when she and I were working together to make sure that she had the email transferred across. And I, you know, helped her with some you know, questions about how to potentially do that, and then she was off in the last or Georgia and was gonna you know, check\-in when she got that figured out. So so I wouldn't start it off until we know that she's managed to get the email, you know, transfer across to her own account or computer. And, you know, I'm fine with leaving it open for that purpose. But, you know, once that's done, then I don't think she will need it or we need it or what have you. So

Them: Alright. I'm gonna

Me: now how to find that out from her? I don't know. I I would reach out to her, you know, if you've got channels directly. Mhmm. No. That's what I mean. You you can you can text her more

Them: I'm not gonna go through Slack. I'll just text her.

Me: because I don't know that she's necessarily monitoring other channels anyway. So

Them: Right. I'll I'll reach out to her and just say, hey. You know, working on shutting down

Me: Yep. That sounds exactly right. Yep.

Them: you know, stuff. Just wanna con confirm you've got what you need, and you're all set.

Me: Yep.

Them: Before I shut it down. Because I also have to figure out where her iPad is that is

Me: Right.

Them: on the Concord Verizon account. Because if she thinks she's turned it in, I don't know where it is.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I you know? If that's the case, I'm just gonna shut it off the line and

Me: Yeah. Right?

Them: assume it's one of the ones that got sent off.

Me: Yeah. Right. Mhmm.

Them: But alright. So, anyhow, so I I'm just working on this fall and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: thing. I'll talk to Sue about who's gonna handle Sarah Havind. I will get this policies thing together. I'll go over it with Sue. I'll put it in the core channel just because

Me: Sir,

Them: I I think I'm gonna put it in core as a done deal, not a

Me: I think so. Yeah. Yep.

Them: you know, it'll be

Me: Yep.

Them: and I discussed this. This is where we are in volunteers. You know, we just need to as especially in this climate, we need to follow the letter of

Me: Yep. Total I totally agree. Yep. Yeah. And I and I talked with Jay about this a little bit, you know, a few months ago when, you know, Sarah was leaving. You know, Sarah's leaving, came onto the radar screen, Jraiff was of betwixt in between about support out in Oregon, etcetera. And she had said, well, you know, I said, she can't work us if you can't volunteer. And she got that, I felt like. And then she said, well, we've got other schools and something, and maybe she could and I was like, you know, there's, you know, I can't I can't be, you know, say one thing or another about what Sarah does. So, like, if Sarah went school who was a partner with us and worked for that school as a something or to be paid for that school. Fine. Like, sure. It's not but it doesn't involve

Them: Right. If the school

Me: you know. So maybe something like that would play out. If school wants to hire her or some you know, organization there that we've been working with wants to hire her and then she consults with them, you know, that's that's above board and and fine. So maybe she'll find something like that. Mhmm.

Them: Right. Absolutely. So if if if there's a school out there that wants us to wants with us and they want to bring Sarah in as a volunteer for the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: school. To support the teachers then absolutely, as long as she's a volunteer for the

Me: Yep.

Them: school supporting the teachers and not a volunteer for Concord.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: Right. Yeah, she's volunteering for the PTA of the school because she's got this breadth of knowledge.

Me: Yep.

Them: But she's not a Concord volunteer.

Me: Mhmm. Exactly. Yep. I agree. Mhmm.

Them: So I and I'm happy to help sort that out with them. But

Me: Yes.

Them: we need to have a con somebody needs to have a conversation with Jay and Carolyn and and

Me: Yeah. And I'm and and I don't think this has come up since

Them: and

Me: with JSAO. I think it may have faded into the distance, but I'm just just letting you know that that's, you know, that's the the sort of takeaway that I had when she was like, well, she could volunteer for somebody else or work for somebody else. I was like, if it's not us, you know, then it's her it's her gig. That's, you know, that's totally It's just that we can't have her coming back through us in any way.

Them: Right. Right. So I'll I'll actually talk to, Sue and I. I'll take that take that on. I know Sue doesn't need anything else to take on, but Sue and I will take that one on.

Me: Yeah. I think that's just I think that's just right. Right. Mhmm. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Pluto boards. We need to I'm gonna post something on core unless you wanna do it. That just says, hey. We need to start putting on these KUDO boards. No one's posted

Me: Okay. Yeah.

Them: them yet. And I think people are a little burnt out. But I think if we start putting messages on at

Me: Yep.

Them: least it will at least it will start to get

Me: Right.

Them: where I I think people don't like to be the first one.

Me: Yep.

Them: So

Me: Exactly. Mhmm. Yeah. And I think that's I think that's appropriate to post the core and to get the ball rolling, you know, to today, tomorrow. Mhmm.

Them: I'll I'll put something on on core that just says, hey. The Kudo boards are active. Can we start getting our things on? People don't like to be the first and

Me: Exactly. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: we need to get them moving. Alright. And then And then Sarah did share her document with me. I haven't had a chance to look at it yet. But I will I will start looking at it. And if we can start maybe assigning if there are certain things you wanna start assigning,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Sue and I can start assigning what I'll take over, what Sue will take over, what we think Cynthia can take over, or maybe you wanna if there are things you are really

Me: Yeah. And and I've yep. And I've I've been looking at that with her as well, and I debriefed

Them: clear you could have

Me: with her a lot about, some some of the process, pieces about how she's gone about things, I'm the background. That Zapier thing was part of my experiment with I'm I'm figuring out what portions of this I can know, automate or or connect into systems I already have, versus things that, you know, are completely separate. So I'll know more about that as the next week or so comes along too.

Them: Okay. That would be great. I mean, you know, things with the board stuff,

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Exactly.

Them: I can you know, I have that calendar. I have no problem October 1 going in and saying, okay. This is the timeline we set up for here.

Me: Yep.

Them: And going into to my calendar and your calendar and putting reminders on

Me: Yep.

Them: every day when something's due.

Me: Yep. Yeah. That seems perfectly fine.

Them: You know? So I'm happy to do that, but I wanna make sure that, you know, that's a small thing. How do we make

Me: Right.

Them: sure the other things get done and need to be done?

Me: Yeah. Exactly.

Them: And then, you know, for the November board meeting, I you know, if you and I will just be in close contact. The biggest the biggest thing for the November board meeting is you and Helen deciding if it's gonna be one day or two,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and the timing.

Me: Yep.

Them: Because if I can get that out to people in and get the calendar invite out,

Me: Yes.

Them: then they're less stressed about when they get the board mailing.

Me: Mhmm. I totally agree. And

Them: So if if that can be on your calendar for

Me: she and I she and I have a call on the week the week after this for me, next Thursday. So we can try to make that top of the schedule for that if we don't talk about it during the board meeting, which we probably won't continue. Mhmm.

Them: Right. So if we can

Me: Yep.

Them: know, if we can get that, we can do that. So I will add, I will add the reminders on the calendars but I need you to add them to your to do list because I I don't that I don't have.

Me: Yes. Yep.

Them: I don't you know, I'm like, how do you and I coordinate those? Do I just type

Me: And I was

Them: dropping things on your calendar? Or

Me: in terms of general meetings, I'm working that through a little bit. I'm trying to make a way for for sort of ad hoc meetings to happen without making my calendar into Swiss cheese. And in terms of repeating things or obvious stuff like you know, board packet due dates, you know, those those sorts of things you can drop onto my calendar as you know, all the events or something like that. And we'll calibrate over the next few weeks on how to schedule things. School's starting up too, so I'm blocking out times when I know I might not be available because of shuttling or what have you. I think I'm gonna use Google Calendar appointments in in some cases, so I'm gonna have know, a big chunk of time that can just kinda book

Them: Mhmm.

Me: on their own. So that then I know that I've got space, but it's not know, smack in the middle of a time when I was, you know, working or going somewhere or what have you. And then recurring meetings, I'm Sarah's been setting up a bunch of those, but I'm gonna have a get a system to set those up too. So I think some of the big pieces of calendar management I can start to automate. And other pieces, I'll I'll figure out what falls through the cracks over the over the next month or or three weeks or so.

Them: Okay. Mine says Where is my this is oh, there it is. I was like, where did that go? Because, like, I already have for the November meeting,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I already have the packet creation timeline for the November meeting created with all the dates in it.

Me: Yes. Exactly.

Them: Now I have to look at that again because both you and I

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: are away. And, you know, I'm not you're not gonna be able to necessarily

Me: Yeah. So I just put Monday

Them: and it also includes Sarah. So

Me: I just put Monday the tenth as a finalizing for me because because I you know, I'm gonna be gone most of the rest of that week. So Mhmm.

Them: Alright. So I'll I'll redo those dates in a you'll have everything on the tenth.

Me: Yep.

Them: I'm working on the tenth.

Me: Okay. Yeah. That's fine.

Them: The eleventh is the holiday, and I'm flying back on the twelfth. So you'll be at the conference the twelfth,

Me: Exactly. I'll probably be flying away on the eleventh.

Them: But I know if even if you're at a conference,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: right, if I'm reading through something, because that's a great thing for me to read on the plane.

Me: Yeah. Definitely.

Them: If I'm reading through something and I

Me: Oh, yeah.

Them: find a typo or whatever, those are the kinds of things I can

Me: Yep. That's exact

Them: make a list in Slack to you. And you're in the hotel, you can just fix them all.

Me: exactly right. Yep. Exactly.

Them: So I can do that. So, yeah, I think that'll be an easy one. And then you know, those are the things that Sue and I are already starting to work on about what happens you know, what happens for February, what happens when I'm not here. Are those

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, Sue and you know, I'm gonna I told Sue I would stay you know, I'll do payroll and benefits for her, but if it turns you need me to at least do the February board stuff in we get somebody else or whatever in place,

Me: Alright. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: What I'm saying is I'm not I'm not

Me: Not gonna evaporate. Right? Yeah.

Them: dropping off the face of the Right. You know, you know, I I'm not doing any major traveling.

Me: Yep.

Them: Right away. I mean, I'm going away in January for a little bit, but not anything that's gonna

Me: Yeah. No. That's good to know. I agree.

Them: you know, I'm not

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I'm not I'm not right. I'm not evaporating. I'm not going anywhere.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I'm not, you know, not selling my house and moving to the

Me: Yet.

Them: other side of the earth. Yet.

Me: Right? Yeah.

Them: Yet. Well, and it won't be the other side of the earth, not in this climate. It might be the other side of the

Me: There we go. Right?

Them: country, but you know, from one blue state to another. But

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Right.

Them: so know, as I said to Sue, I can I can do these specific things? It's not

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: it's not like I'm gonna totally drop off the face of the earth.

Me: I know that that's that's good to know. We're

Them: But if we we'll see how November goes.

Me: Yeah. We just need to calibrate, you know, as we the things come up and and figure it out. And November will be weird in its own way because of proposal deadlines and other kinds of things. But if we can get that one to work, then we can get anything to work. The proposal's the week

Them: Right. Right. Because I think the proposal deadlines are the week the

Me: week before or two weeks before, you know, confer that week, yada yada yada. So Mhmm.

Them: Right. Well, I tried I tried, to skip the meeting schedule based around like, I always ask Lisa when the

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: d r k twelves are due.

Me: Yep.

Them: Because I know that makes a difference.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But we'll, you know, we'll make it work.

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: I just like to not have you

Me: Yep.

Them: totally crazed as we make it all work.

Me: No. I I agree. Yeah. Well, we've got DRK 12 that day that the conference starts, of course, and I arrived till the week before, so we'll have to figure it out, I guess.

Them: I can't believe NSTA is right off both. Doctor, k 12,

Me: NSA doesn't care about that. No. They're due the day it starts.

Them: due when? The week before?

Me: But they're not related to one another at all. So Mhmm.

Them: Oh, alright.

Me: Teachers don't apply for NSF grants. Mhmm.

Them: Alright. Alright. So those are the things on my list.

Me: Okay.

Them: Not a lot of the I mean, a lot, but not a lot. I'm doing my exit meetings. I you know, in my meetings, I've said to people that certainly if they wanna a chat with you in the next week, they should

Me: Yep. I think Boris reached out to me already.

Them: feel free to reach out.

Me: And I'm trying to find a time with him next week as well. And had some connection. I had an reverse exit interview with Talia yesterday. She's sort of thinking through what wants to do, and she really appreciated doing some conversations. And she said, said, jeez. We talked to other people at Concord as well, so that's good. And other people are saying, yeah. Well, happy for you to write me something either now or, you know, when I feel like I know I need or what have you. So I'm getting a little bit of of, you know, reach out here and there. I know, you know, connected with people a little bit over the previous month and a half, written some recommendations on LinkedIn and stuff.

Them: Good. I've been, yeah. I met with Sarah Haven yesterday. I meet with Sarah Curtis today.

Me: K.

Them: And then I have Lucy Boris, and Zach next week.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know? And it's just doing the technical stuff. And, you know, we're letting be letting people keep their computers except bars. I have to figure out when we when we got his computer. That's been my problem is you know, when did we get them? Like, did we get

Me: Right. Right.

Them: new computer when we hired him? This is why not having an inventory has

Me: Uh\-huh. Right.

Them: been issue.

Me: Yep.

Them: But that's you know, just doing those exits and then trying to do that final payroll.

Me: Yep.

Them: Just so that you know as you're going through all because I I know you get a zillion emails and whatever, but just so you know, has changed their name.

Me: Good.

Them: By putting that in the We News.

Me: That's good to know.

Them: They are now Ben Sure.

Me: V e n s u r e?

Them: Yeah. V e n s u r a.

Me: Okay.

Them: They have not changed it. I don't think when you log in, I think it still says well, because it says Concord Consortium when you when you but I think the, the emails still come through as workforce now.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But just in case you see something come through as ensure,

Me: That's good to know.

Them: don't

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: just delete it because you don't know it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I don't think Concord has a overall list of of URLs that we block. I I always told Lorelei that you know, about this change. So from their end, they'll take care of that. But I just wanted you to know in case

Me: Yep.

Them: yeah.

Me: That's good to know. Okay.

Them: And that's it. There's nothing

Me: Yeah.

Them: just more you know? I know

Me: Mhmm.

Them: send out the board conflict of interest forms. I used to do them in October, but I it's such a

Me: Right.

Them: I'm chasing all the time. I figure if I get them out today, I can remind people tomorrow. If I don't get them out

Me: Right.

Them: today, I can still tomorrow say, you'll be getting them in the next week.

Me: Yep.

Them: Please make sure they're the return. It
