Transcript:

Me: Hi, Alan. How are you?

Them: Chad. Just reinforcing a few things that came up at the meeting. I the conversation was mostly, firstly, very positive about having to moving on the on the fundraising front.

Me: Right?

Them: Everybody's very pleased with how that's gone forward, and, obviously, Rick has been a great help.

Me: Yes. Great.

Them: Not so sure that your consultant on the business side is as helpful.

Me: Right.

Them: I what you're feeling, but

Me: So you're saying meaning the person that we have don't have a person or the person that I'm proposing

Them: You had somebody who helped with well,

Me: Oh, very briefly. We don't he was basically there for a few days, and and

Them: Okay.

Me: not really there at all. So

Them: So there's no there's no ongoing contact with that person?

Me: No. He he

Them: And and you're you're looking for somebody?

Me: we need we need somebody who well, yeah. I mean, I ideally, we'd have two, really. We'd it was somebody for this, you know, product user stuff for a brief time and somebody long term who could help us, you know, think about sales and business development, and we don't have either of those right now.

Them: Right. Well, people were a little doubtful. That you you were that that you're using stuff I mean, yes, you need to listen teachers, but in terms of defining your future business model, they're probably not the audience.

Me: Sure. Yep.

Them: That you need. So thinking about that and thinking, you know, in these given that the business model needs to move forward fairly quickly,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: figuring where your focus is, Two things. One is the licensing

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: finding a model, and moving forward on that. That surgeon, do it quickly.

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: The other is really having a vision as to what the role of Concord is in AI and education.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Make sure that vision is clearly formulated.

Me: Yes. I agree.

Them: Betty, Heidi had an interesting suggestion there. Apparently, NSF funded the of centers on AI in education.

Me: Yep.

Them: One of which is Bill Penwell.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And he might be a good person to talk to. Do you know Bill?

Me: Right. Yes. So yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I think having a conversation with him about what you're you know, first of all, getting your thinking in in in line in some way, what is it that's special about Concord in terms of AI and education?

Me: Right.

Them: And and talking to him about what the needs are, what they've discovered with their work, where they are.

Me: Right.

Them: Maybe asking Heidi about whether there are others of those senses that we should she mentioned Bill, but she didn't mention the

Me: No. There are others. We've been down to North Carolina to and connected to folks there about the center that they have, which was awarded a year or so the one in Colorado, I think, but around the same time. Yes.

Them: Okay. So you know who it is. Good. Talk to them. And frame that. And in terms of your user thing, perhaps David is your best bet.

Me: Yeah. I can talk to him more to try to get a sense of of thinking on that.

Them: A bit. How do you use that? To use that question. It seems at the you're more on the listening side rather than the questioning side. But maybe there's some mix between the open ended what do you think questions and the questions which are more driven towards something you have

Me: Mhmm. Yes.

Them: in mind. Like, in platform is is the thing we have to to market

Me: Yeah.

Them: What would teachers want from it? Or what would publish it?

Me: Yeah. I mean, in in thinking about it, you know, after the

Them: For that

Me: call, you know, I I'm recognizing that I think what's well, two things. I think overall, it's a it's a product development question, sort of a product development business question. And I think what we ultimately need is somebody who can sit with us and say, What should Concord's take on product development be as an R and D company right now? Where should we sit in the world of trying to develop products and for whom? What's the audience and how much energy in what ways.

Them: Yeah. And and I don't think we we would ever be in the position of saying, okay. We're gonna do a market survey and develop a product in area x where we don't have

Me: Well right. No. I know. I agree.

Them: anything. So it's more a matter of what products do we have that could be developed into

Me: Right.

Them: income earning capabilities.

Me: Yeah. No. To to be clear, I mean, I'm I'm both both that, which is product development because we have research research prototypes now and we'd need to choose how to develop them or mix them into products. Also, the long term, like over five years, we're gonna build something new, some new things, and understanding where those fit in the scheme of you know, just to research something or somewhere else, is is important. You know? And and all that, I think, is part of the picture.

Them: Yeah. How do we how do we talk our proposals to give us things which have better capability

Me: Right.

Them: at the end of the NSF funding cycle to be

Me: Mhmm. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: ready for product development.

Me: And and in emphasizing the user listing part, you know, that's mostly me introducing the concepts so people understand it when I say it. Not to say that that's the only thing we're doing is twiddling our thumbs and listening to We've got lots of things that we're doing. It's really a matter of figuring out of the five or seven things that exist that we could do something with how do we mix and match and what do we inflate and what do we, you know, ignore? And, you know, can we get some signal from people besides ourselves to

Them: Uh\-huh.

Me: help guide us in that

Them: And figuring out who who those people are. I mean,

Me: Yeah. We're not gonna develop something in this

Them: listening to teachers brings you one set of information, but that may be not

Me: Right.

Them: the only set of information you need.

Me: Yep. Yep. No. I agree. Yeah. And we think that it's got a it's gotta serve teachers in some ways, so, you know, starting there is good.

Them: Yes.

Me: But, you know, teachers, it's districts, and it's definitely companies as well. It's just a little bit harder to

Them: Yeah. You can you can do focus

Me: figure out how to to talk to them without using them.

Them: sections with companies.

Me: Exactly. Yeah. So so yeah. No. I think I think that all that's exactly right. And, you know, we're not we're not expecting more developing know, somebody wakes up in the morning and has heard a teacher and we're developing a line of stuffed animals or something. You know, it's it's very much in the zone of things that we have.

Them: Well, I do think I think the the

Me: But

Them: your your interactive math platform, I mean, developed it with a

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: small amount of curriculum there. In a in a project which was kinda closed.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right. So where does that interactive platform go and how can it move

Me: Yeah.

Them: forward Maybe

Me: Think I think it's there's huge possibility in that, and that to me is a very open question. Is it something for a public publisher? Is it something for somebody who thinks differently about, you know, some subset of the of the, features? Is it both of the above? We don't really know yet. So that's and I think it's sitting there untapped.

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And that that interactivity is a is a unique capability, think.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yes.

Them: So

Me: Yeah. And we're talking on the other side about simulations and AI and you know, customizability and interactivity on that side of things. How can we develop you know, something that nobody else has the the raw materials

Them: What what's the role of AI you think of it of AI as a tool for putting

Me: I

Them: together simulations? Or

Me: so one example might be you know, how can we so I didn't get into this in the meeting, but we had a very interesting, focus group with some teachers at a conference about a

Them: Mhmm.

Me: two weeks ago. And all of them, this was from three states in Rhode Island, those 10 people in the room nodded when one person said, we are using open SIOAD because we have to. And, but we feel like it's not you know, it's sort of boring the students. Like, I feel like I'm the sage on the stage, which

Them: It wasn't intended that way.

Me: is ironic because obviously it's not at all intended that way. Right? But sort of many people were nodding with that notion. Also, I don't quite connect with it, they would say. One of these teachers said, my kids are in Rhode Island. You know, they're not in Colorado, so that example from Colorado doesn't connect with them. So she had rewritten a whole unit to be place based for her in, you know, the state that she was in, for example. The coastal scenario. Other people were talking about

Them: Right.

Me: being loving or appreciating the idea of building forward on a phenomenon over time. Talking about bath bombs for five weeks bores the kids and bores them. So there was these strains of variation on interactivity, but concern about about customizing it in a safe way that was so aligned and what have you, and the idea of wanting to customize so all of that together is, you know, we've been scratching our heads and say, oh, is there an opportunity there? For providing, say, customizable interactive experiences that connect with or layer onto OpenAI or onto, you know, OpenSciEd. And here's a, you know, light or or a bit different interactive version that unit that you're required to use that's still meets the requirements. And, you know, could we use AI to custom I mean, there's an ecosystem situation. You know? Give me five, you know, organisms out of the 20 possible ones, and I'll custom it. It's still an ecosystem. It's still got the interactions that you need. It still comes out with something

Them: Mhmm.

Me: you know, that's meaningful in the end. Maybe all five students choose five different things, but in some way, we're you a variation on that that pulls together the common strands, you know, things like that. Are there ways that we can use our tool

Them: That that sounds like a research proposal.

Me: Right? Exactly. Yep. Are there ways that we can use our tools that nobody else has those tools, and are

Them: Yes.

Me: wherewithal and understanding think about AI differently than just can I chat with fill in the blank? Right? Mhmm.

Them: Right. Right. So that formulating that in a clearer way

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so you can communicate it to people

Me: Yep.

Them: is is important. And

Me: Mhmm.

Them: having a conversation on the OpenAI front and and how teaching use it. Pam has been doing some work on that front too. She's been doing some consulting where she's customizing units for teachers.

Me: Alright. That's good. I should talk to her about that.

Them: So you should definitely talk to her about what's going on in that work.

Me: Yes.

Them: And and about

Me: So

Them: I I think, I mean, the the fact that that Sage Margarita is in those units is actually because Pam put it this.

Me: It could well be. Yep. And, you know, and lots of other of our resources are too. And Codep is in several of them.

Them: Yes.

Me: You know, our seismic explorer is in some

Them: Yeah. And and

Me: And other interactives that are in there are maybe not as strong as they could be and could be changed. So you know, there's nothing that would stop us from making a whole different version or augmentation to the modules or what have

Them: Yeah. Except somebody has to pay for it.

Me: you. Right. Exactly. Well, I mean yeah. Exactly. I've been paying for the the curriculum development.

Them: Yeah.

Me: But so thinking about that, that's one example of is there a product line, quote unquote, of augmentation to or layered on top of open sciad that then takes advantage of the fact that open sciad is a train that's already moving, and lets us build something in there with a captive audience. There's one one sort of example of something that comes out of these conversations. Mhmm.

Them: Yep. Good. Well, not to say that anything you're doing is is is not what you should be doing, but just sort of trying to trying

Me: No. But I'm I'm hearing good good feedback.

Them: to hear and and the question the the one that fascinated me is how do you balance between open ended listening and

Me: Right.

Them: because you have something in mind and you want teacher in feedback on that something.

Me: Mhmm. Well right. And the, I mean, the the reason that I'm pushing a little bit on this, you know, this new notion is because most of the time most company when you read about this, most companies fail at doing the latter, not coming with an idea to the table. But that really trying really being able to listen to what people need

Them: Yeah.

Me: You hear classic business stories of this too. The people who developed Swiffer, was a great example. They spent like a year and a half trying to develop the perfect cleaning device or whatever, and trying it out in focus groups with people in homes finally after a year of development. And it wasn't it wasn't hitting, you with people. They just didn't quite you know, get it, and finally they were exhausted in this house, is the canonical story, and they were trying to get this woman to use the mop and they were, like, making the house dirty behind her and, like, literally sprinkling coffee grounds just as she finally thought

Them: Yes.

Me: the house was done. And they sprinkled coffee grounds on the floor of the kitchen. Went over to its side, grabbed a paper towel, put some water on it, swept it up, and they realized in that moment, oh, it's just about getting clean enough satisfy your needs. That's actually what people wanted, not the full on clean that they were desiring. So they hadn't been listening for what people really wanted. Once they

Them: Yes.

Me: that, they could tilt the whole thing in that direction. All of a sudden, there's this whole thing. So not that different than what they were doing, right? But it's like, Oh, that resonates with people.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Well, it's also how they're messaging what they have.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah. So I think it's more a question of are there things that are resonating? And that's the question I think we don't

Them: Right.

Me: ask ourselves or have to ask ourselves to get the panel to a I mean, does it resonate with the panel? Well, yeah, lots of things will resonate with the panel.

Them: And then

Me: And the thing that resonates with you is probably would too,

Them: right.

Me: if we don't know what that is, then we're not gonna promote. Right?

Them: Right. And finally, Ron made the comment that Rick also has done business development work.

Me: That's interesting. I will I will try to follow\-up with him on that.

Them: So they made me following up with him on some of that way of where where you see, I need some need to talk to somebody about this. Maybe Rick is a is a good somebody to try.

Me: That's a great question. I will I will follow\-up with him and look and and look at how he portrays himself on his, you know, his things as well because that may be overlooked entirely. Also got a good name from somebody, who we know in California who been advising on our oppose our open source project of somebody in Maine who looks versatile and sort of long in the tooth experienced on this sort of thing. And I think, you know, I'm gonna call her up and see if taking us on as a a non startup but product interested, you know, company might be a project So so I think there are some good opportunities. Mhmm.

Them: Great. Great. Well,

Me: Good. Well, this is really useful.

Them: that's about it. I mean, obviously, we're all behind you head

Me: Behind it. Right.

Them: and hoping that if things things go well, but for this

Me: Clinging to our backs the same way we're clinging to each other's backs, hoping that we have more run

Them: same time, yeah. And I hope you're not feeling too scattered.

Me: No. I'm not. I think this is pretty I I I think I think the interesting transition will be over the next month or two, both as we try to keep people writing proposals, more importantly as we transition to being able to say, okay, This is us now. We've been in this we haven't really wanted to talk about the company as openly when we've got people leaving. But once once we've sort of moved to like, okay, the people in the room are left here, we can start to bring people all into a room much more often. I think that will that will provide a different level of momentum and we can, you know, task more people with these questions

Them: Right.

Me: And if we get these, you know, these projects in, the other thing I've been open about is that you know, just because you said x and y and z in your research proposal, doesn't mean that's what you're doing year one. We're gonna think as a company about what we really wanna do, and that might change the way your proposal, you know, money gets spent

Them: Right.

Me: this is a this is an opportunity. You know, we wanna make sure that this money goes to a unified end. Mhmm.

Them: To move it towards the right direction. Yes.

Me: Exactly.

Them: Okay.

Me: Alright.

Them: And that so that that is I if you can

Me: Yep.

Them: for the board, at some point, mean, this is not for tomorrow, but for some time in the next cup couple of months, a description of where where you see us going with AI

Me: Yeah.

Them: in our products.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: For just a short piece, not

Me: Yep.

Them: not a whole long dissertation, but just

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: some ideas so that we understand better what your thinking is.

Me: Uh\-huh. I think I definitely that's something that we're we're trying to to codify for ourselves. You know, for that reason, I would describing. If we've got these grants that are just starting out, we wanna tilt them in a way that's gonna

Them: Exactly. What what

Me: benefit. And AI AI is in every one of those sentences. It's gotta be.

Them: and and how are you how are you going to use AI, and how are you going to make AI visible as a piece of the work that students learn about.

Me: Yes. Yep. Yep. Exactly. Oh, yeah. I can do that for sure. It's it's high on the list for us internally.

Them: Wonderful.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Okay. So that's it. Good meeting. Thank you.

Me: Excellent. Thanks a lot. Best of luck. Yep. And I will check\-in with you. I think maybe it's next week, and then after that, you're gonna be in Cambridge as well, seems like, but we'll still have a call, I think.

Them: Yes. I will be in Cambridge from the third well, in Cambridge or in in, what's it called, Northampton for a couple of days. But but

Me: Alright. Very good.

Them: I'll be right.

Me: Okay. Sounds great.

Them: Okay.

Me: Thanks a lot. Have a great weekend.

Them: You too. Bye.

Me: Mhmm. Bye.
