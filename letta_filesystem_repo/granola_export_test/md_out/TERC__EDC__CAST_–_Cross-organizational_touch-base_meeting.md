So I've been at EDC about eight years, I guess. Me: Yes. I do. I Them: I guess Gotcha. Alternative Me: okay. Them: just doing intros. So Intros. Yes. So I'll turn it to Kelly who's sitting next to me on my screen. Yeah. So I'm Kelly Blackburn. I'm the we just did a big reorg at CAST, I'm now the chief finance and internal operations So I added IT and HR to my purview. That's what happens when we shrink a little bit. I've been a CAST for two years. Kind of going through various roles as kinda some background to these meetings, because I know we have at least three new people on here. Yeah. We started these really when all of the executive orders started to come down, when the cancellations came down, trying to really brainstorm what we were doing, how we were responding. Sharing, you know, concerns and issues we were facing with regard to those, but also kind of just as as small nonprofits in in Massachusetts. So that's kind of that's where they started. Laurie was really beneficial in those because she they were leading the charge on several of those appeals requests specifically with NSF. So Mhmm. Yeah. Just for historical. Like, I think we're all in a little bit of a different place now, but Yeah. No. That's really helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Charlene, I'll pass it to you. Thank you. I'm Charlene. I'm the interim CFO at Turk. I've been here since January. So I've been through all this craziness. That's been going on. Met with Kelly and Chad on numerous occasions. We've been trying to get everything in order but it's it's it's been crazy. And Christine, just recently joined us. So I'll move it to her. Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for the invitation. So Christine, Reich. I just started on July 1 as president of Turk, filling in Laurie's very big shoes. And I'm only a size six, so I feel like I've you know, I have some growing to do. But excited to be here just as a bit of background, I teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Education part time. Richard Jackson at CAST was one of my doctoral advisers I have a fond memory of CAST. But that was many, many moons ago. And Pryor was CEO of Knowledge, which is a social science research nonprofit. And prior to that, I spent about thirty years at the Museum of Science Boston. And so excited to be here and passionate about STEM education, and so grateful for having a group of peers that we can talk about these issues with. So thank you. Chad, I believe you are left. Me: Hi. I'm here. I'm Chad. Nice to meet everybody and to meet you virtually in person, Christine. I'll have to meet you in person in person soon. I've been at Concord coming on sixteen years as president and CEO, and happy to be involved in coordinating in any way, shape, or form, in Sue Browse sends her regrets, or her regards and not her regrets because she's on vacation this week. And enjoying time up in Maine on Deer Isle. So Them: Nice. Nice. Well, I mean, I I sent the poll out and got meeting on the books because Laurie and I talked a couple times and and she said, you know, the next time we do one of these group calls, we'll make sure that you join. And then she transitioned out and Christine started. So I thought it would be it's a crazy time of year, I'm sure, and vacations, but I don't have a particular agenda. I just was saying before, got on that. I think we're probably all wrestling with the same things and you know, whether it's kind of paying attention to what federal agencies are doing or not doing or you know, diversifying where we seek funding from and know, we're monitoring the policy landscape a lot, and, you know, we're all doing different things on social media and with the press, etcetera, and the fact that we're also the Massachusetts based companies, I thought, you know, there may be some strength in numbers if we even wanna do some things with the state level. So other than that, I don't know what else has been touched on. So those are just kind of, you know, laundry list of things on my mind, but really happy to have anybody jump in with whatever's in your mind. Yeah. I actually I have kind of a from one of our previous meetings. I as I mentioned, quite a few of us had NSF grant cancellations. We submitted our appeal like they told us to and all the things We finally received our final payment after a month of reaching out to various individuals. We would ask for feedback and that person had left. We'd move on to the next person. It was kinda like whack a mole. But we have not heard anything about our appeal. And I'm not sure if anyone else has either. We haven't. We've been working with Laurie has set up a us to work with a legal firm that is active in the process. What I can give you I don't know how many of you are also working with lawyers on this, I can give you an update on what he shared. What he shared is that right now, there's a lot going on around jurisdiction and which courts actually have jurisdiction around appeals and the cancellations. So he was not recommending that we engage in any suit unless we had deep pockets, which we don't because it would take many years to get through. What he did say is that no one is here hearing about I don't wanna say no one. Very few people are hearing about their appeals. And that this is out of compliance with NSF's stated process. So our next step is for him to do outreach to the minority leader of the congressional group that oversees NSF. To let them know that they're out of compliance. And I think it's someone I think it's a congressperson from Hawaii. And that I might engage with him in communication around that. And so one of the things he and I did talk about was reaching out to Massachusetts, and I asked him if that would make sense. And he said, not at the moment because it's really this minority leader. That's responsible for the committee that would make the most sense. But I can also ask again because it may not hurt if a group of us wanted to put an appeal to our senators and and congressional representatives to talk about the absence of the appeal because that does seem to be in strict violation of your code. Yeah. And I think you're right in that there's so much else going on right now that it's I mean, we're we're adding it to the list. We're obviously moving forward. We you know, they said make sure you get your appeal in so that you can be included on any type of action in the future. But you're totally right that it's gonna be a years long effort. It's not gonna be quick turnaround. We've kind of refocused our efforts to take we've only had one NSF grant terminate thus far, but we taking the curriculum and the information. We were almost entering into year four, into our final year. So we already have a lot of data We're already you know, trying to put it out there in terms of the curriculum and some of the early results that we've had. To try to gain try to turn it into a training opportunity or a fee for service type of opportunity where obviously, the curriculum is free because it was developed under the grant, but the training to implement the curriculum we work with a drone company because that's also part of that process. We're just having to move forward because we can't sit and wait. You know? It's not No. We're all we obviously also don't have deep pockets. I think one of the other things that we also discussed previously is that CAST for this fiscal year, our total makeup of federal funds is about 30% of our overall budget. Yeah. In previous years, it was much, much higher, but we're kind of, you know, riding the wave a little bit. The withholding of of federal funds to schools has also had a pretty significant impact. Yep. Both real, like, you know, people can't contracts, but also perceived. So schools are at districts and state education offices are much more nervous. Mhmm. Don't want to enter into long term contracts when their federal funding is is more isn't stable. So yeah, we've also I I don't know how much Department of Ed funding you all have, but we've also heard some quite a few rumors that there will be some more grant cancellations coming, this month. It's primarily from OSEP. So which is where our most of our grants live. So yeah, And so outside of the federal funding, so you have state you have worked with states directly, what are the other things that sort of make up what you do? Yeah. So it's interesting because with the with the loss of ESSER funding, once those once the COVID relief funding for schools ended, we previously had years long large contracts with states. As the ESSER funding ended, even before all of this current chaos, we've noticed smaller contracts with states, shorter turnaround time. So those have continued, but primarily seen it with states that aren't heavily reliant on federal funding. So California, is a big one for us that we continue to have state contracts with. But we also work with other education type organizations. So we have a workforce development career CTE branch at CAST. We work with community colleges. We work with, we've had some federal contracts, in the biomanufacturing primarily area trying to increase, workforce training, that type of thing. So that's a big one. We've also Mhmm. Mhmm. We had dipped our toe into global, and we're kind of jumping all in now. So we have some, we're finalizing a contract with the country of Paraguay. We've got a contract with Angola, so it's our first contract on the Continent Of Africa. So we're trying to be nimble, trying to you know, spread our wings and get some contacts. But global seems be you know, it it is a little scarier because there are all these other parameters, the value added tax, all of the other contracts that we have to really negotiate a little differently. But that seems to be the direction we're heading is to try to diversify in that way Okay. Are you working are you contracting directly with countries or or ministries or whatever within countries? Or through, like, other foreign aid? Yeah. So right now, like, our Paraguay contract is with the Ministry of Education. Okay. The current Minister of Education is a big proponent of UDL. And he was I think he received his education in The US. But with others, like our contract in Angola is actually with in international schools, organization. So, you know, they're English speaking schools housed for for American students and families. Okay. But the other ones, we do have a few that are directly with school districts. Within other countries. I think there's one in Denmark that we're currently negotiating. We worked with Australia. It's which it's not consistent. I think that's the hard part is we always relied on federal funding as this, like, of course, it's there. It's there for five years, and it's regular, and we ask for money, and they pay us. So transitioning away from that, reliable long term project, it's it's definitely a culture shift. Everyone. Yeah. I I feel that pain a lot. And and, I mean, not just reliable, but our best funder. Exactly. For decades and biggest funder for decades. So Right. Yeah. It's definitely a it's definitely a painful shift. And I think nimble is definitely the word of the year. Yes. Yeah. That in every synonym. I think we've used them all. And yeah, that's where we are too. So that's helpful. Have Yeah. I'll add a little bit about us, I guess, and Cindy obviously can Yep. Chime in a lot more. Yeah. You know, similarly, a bulk of our funding has been federal funding in state. For us, USAID was a big portion of our in our funding, so that hit came very early on. So so that's been significant. On the on The US side, the RELs were those were are probably our largest hits in the education space. NSF, I feel it's been sort of a mixed bag. It's been a lot of things where we're you know, we have smaller portions of things. We're an evaluator or a sub that what's what's more is just sort of the uncertainty of everything that's in the pipeline, you not hearing on anything, getting questions, nothing's moving forward, Program officers are, you know, unresponsive or gone. Here one day, gone the next kind of thing. So but and we also have health work as well. So Right. I mean, that's yeah. I mean, just to build on what Sarita said. I mean, honestly, in comparison to what happened on the international side, I feel like we have gotten off fairly easy on The US side. The RELs ready to learn was the big one. For us. And one other. But I think for the NSF stuff, it always felt like either smaller portions or things that were almost over anyway. And so, frankly, able to, like, under under the kind of the closeout work, all even if not come totally finishing, mostly getting there. So I feel like, knock wood, we got off kind of easy with NSF. Although, trying to figure out what to do going forward is a head scratcher. Know? Like, the grant programs, some of them still there. And do we put time and resources into them? You know? There's part of me that says, so sick of these people. Not NSF, but federal government. Why bother? Why put time, money into things that we're not hearing on things that are already in? And then you think, But if something good happens so trying to figure out that balancing act is is not easy. And it's stuff we know how to do. Right? So you think, yeah. We know how to do that, and so we don't have to be quite as nimble. On those. But it does take away from the time to to explore the new avenues. So Me: Yeah. I agree on the NSF side. We're, you know, scratching our heads in the same way. I think that Them: mean, Me: know, a couple of program officers I had talked to down at the more recent PI meeting said the advice there was write the first 10 pages of your proposal and then be ready to write the last five once you know what this solicitation is, essentially. So when they were saying, get your ideas there, you know, gather them up, give them, and, you know, obviously, there have been various calls at points for proposal pressure from, you know, those inside it. NSF to say they need to be able to point to things, which is understood and want to support them in any way we can. Yet sure. But if it's all in vain, then we all need to know that too. So it's six of one half dozen of another complication. Them: Yeah. Yeah. I think too, just we've attended a few webinars and gotten consult. From an attorney too. When you when you look at the new awards coming out, obviously, we basically took out any projection for new federal funding from our current fiscal year budget, and we're not including any going forward. Because that's just not reliable. But heard from we attended a webinar that was hosted by InnovateEDU, and they said that with the new awards coming out, there is also some problematic language attached to it. So they have, you know, the false claims act, So you have to basically say, that you're not engaging in any DEI. If you if you receive these federal funds so not only are they affecting the federal funds, but any funds at your organization. While DEI is not inherently illegal, it's then saying that they can file false claims acts against you. If they find out that you're doing it, they're encouraging whistleblowers, all the things. Very, very scary. So we're also very cautious with how we proceed with federal funding. We're looking more at contractor level. So if someone if an entity is willing, to take on that risk, we would be happy to join their proposal as a contractor, but not as a sub. Because we don't want that federal flow down. And until you really start seeing more awards come out, the person we talked with was was was her area of expertise was in department of ed. The new award she was seeing from department of ed had that language. It's just not I mean, CAST, that's what we do. It's inclusive education. We built it into our guidelines last year. Like, it's not something we're changing. Yeah. But so it is it is scary, you know. So, yeah, that's So can I just I just follow\-up? So are they are they saying that it doesn't matter where you're doing EDI they'll come get you? Because know at one point, it was more like, long as you're not doing it with federal funds, Yeah. So the new language is Okay. The new language is very concerning because the first part is basically a scare tactic. To say if you engage in illegal DEI, which, again, that's a misnomer. DEI is not illegal. Yeah. But then the second part says, if you engage if any group within your organization engages in DEI Okay. And they find out, it'll be false claims acts, which is up to three times damages. So the way they explained it was for every drawdown you do, they can come after you for three times that amount. Okay. Obviously, they're not they're not giving you all the funding upfront, but it's as you do your drawdowns. Okay. That thing will it's Okay. Now I think part of it is, will they enforce it? That you have to assume they will. And do you have clarity on what they mean by DEI practice? Because there are some I mean, there there are some practices, right, that even during the Biden administration, right, that that came out as you know, the harvest affirmative action, but then there's a number of ones that said that if you're providing preferential treatment based on certain demographic characteristics. So our know when the executive orders were first coming out, that's where the Trump administration everyone was kinda focusing in on those. But one are DEI Uh\-huh. Practices. Right? And so I think that there's a lot because it says illegal DEI practices, it's those I have interpreted that as those that have already been deemed illegal as opposed to just saying, inclusion. I think yeah. I think that's one of the out outstanding questions is what they actually mean by that. But there was also a a memo from the Department of Justice. I think it was dated, like, July, but it didn't come out until August 1 where they basically said, DEI is illegal. It's all bad. But if you use different words, to explain still gonna come get you. So that one was very concerning. Because it I I can find it, I will drop it in. Because that one went further to say, even if you're not because that, obviously, all the universities changed the language. They took out diversity, equity, inclusion, and they called it office of belonging or something like it's the same mission, but they just called it something different. So that's that was an update from last week or the week before, rather. Put in the chat the most recent Me: Yeah. Them: Yeah. I don't know if everyone had seen that already. Me: Yeah. I was on vacation last Them: Yep. I saw that. Me: weekend, so I've skimmed read it once and, you know, mulled over it. But haven't processed too much beyond that. I've Some folks have been chatting with are processing it a little bit. August obviously is a black hole. Think people are thinking too much. Obviously concerning and head scratching at the same time. Obviously, there are lots of layers that are concerning, especially the to presidential priorities, not Congress priorities, not something priorities. Basically, I could say no. To whatever. And other pieces too including the justification of drawdowns essentially seems like it's a big trap. And then there's the whole I don't even know if it's three\-dimensional just I hesitate to give anybody the credit of that much strategy or what have you, but around the gold standard science layers of everything. That whole EO, which is completely perplexing to me like, I can't even figure out Them: Yes. Me: what the agenda I mean, clearly, there's some agenda by somebody other than the administration being with groundwork trying to be laid there. But I can't quite figure out exactly what it is besides this isn't reproducible so therefore it's wrong. So that whole layer is fascinating. To me. Them: Well, they're going back to the early two thousands when it came out about, what, Me: Mhmm. Them: scientific research and education is, that that's what I was Me: But, I mean, it's it's you know, there there's a previous CEO, Them: wondering about. Me: about gold standard science as well, which clearly wasn't about education research. Maybe it's candy and whatever. But it was it was one of those where like, you read the whole thing and you agreed with 95% of it and that makes you really wonder what's going on. Mean, clearly, it doesn't mean what it says. You know, it may just be something that just got signed, but I I don't know what the agenda is underneath it. Them: Are there other agencies? So I know that with, for example, you know, our workforce development work, NSF has been one of our you know, bigger funders. But, you know, looking at the Department of Labor, we just recently pursued something with the Department of you know, sort of casting the net as wider and wider, where we don't actually have necessarily the best relationships because it's just just still haven't been the agencies that we've pursued. But so, you know, trying to find other while we nonfederal funding foundations and other things, which is a whole other quagmire, it feels like, right now because they're panicking in their own ways. And holding back in their own ways. Yeah. Just curious about sort of other homes for work where we're not all exactly in the same spaces, but we're in very, very similar spaces too. So Yeah. I mean, ours, like, again, we're trying to we're we're taking work where we can get it for on the federal landscape, but we're being very cautious. Cautious. One of the ways we're kind of switching gears a little bit is to offer different types of products. So we do have courses. We have credentials, but now we're trying to do more self paced They're they're essentially more passive income after we build them that people could just take them every month. We're also pricing them to target individuals. Knowing the school districts may not have the PD funds. So we're trying to go over quantity, rather than, like, the initial sale price or the initial the the initial cost. Just trying to think of different avenues to do that. Just had our our annual conference last month, which was all I don't know if you guys do in person events, but holy cow, we will not. Be doing that next year. You know? Obviously, started planning a long time ago, and it was in DC right down the road from Washington. It was a very successful event, but it it probably caused a lot more gray hairs than was worth it. So but, again, the other thing we're thinking about is is online. We're doing events. We're trying to target people that again, may not rely on that funding to pay for it. I we're we're casting a very wide net We do have and I I think we do have some like, mentioned, we did have a couple of federal contracts on the military side or on the Yeah. Biomanufacturing. Army is one that we have, but those those were actually two of our contracts were the first to be canceled. Because it was specifically targeting DEI. So it it's it's embedded. It's literally embedded everywhere. So trying to it's kind of you know, trying to navigate it without stepping in something. We are a much smaller organization. We ended up doing a reduction in force in June. We had other people leave because they're seeking employment that isn't reliant on federal funding. It's just very stressful. You know, we have people going back to teach. But we have decreased our staff size significantly because that is our bigger our biggest cost, this staff. Me: Yep. Them: So Yep. Same. We've done the same. Same. Same. And that's true for any organization. Doesn't matter. Yeah. So, Kelly, I'm struck what I I have lost track of CAST through the years, and I was you know, partnered with it a lot years ago when it was much more focused. And I was just going through your website, and I'm surprised by how few researchers you have on staff. And I'm wondering if you can talk about or maybe it happened before you came, that transition from being a research organization to being more of a kind of expertise consulting professional development. Organization. Yeah. So we celebrated our fortieth year last year. And like I said, I've only been here since 2023\. But over time, CAST has really fluctuated in where their biggest source of revenue was. They started out, you know, with billable services. To families, and then it really grew to foundations. And foundations was the largest funder for a really long time. And then research kind of took over. And so we're just kind of in this next phase. We used to have the AIM Center, so the accessible material. It was a huge center grant from the Department of Ed. For, like, I think they had it for twenty three years. They rewrote the solicitation to change it. They focused less on technical assistance and more on digital materials. They made it a four year grant instead of five. And then we were not refunded under that new solicitation. University of Utah was awarded that one in 2024\. So that was our biggest change, our biggest decrease in research. We did have a reduction in staff at that time too just because we had so many people fully funded. By that grant. So it is changing. You know? And the other piece too is that CAST used to do a lot education technology. Where they were developing things. Well, now in the current landscape, products, AI, everything is just so much quicker to be presented and then rolled out all of a sudden, it's obsolete. So that's also something that we're recognizing that the the sector is really not there for us to develop that technology because there's so many other players in that field, and they can do it a whole lot quicker. Than we can. So that's one reason why we've kind of switched to the consultation professional development Also, during COVID, professional development, that is that skyrocketed. Schools needed professional development. They had all this extra funding. To use, and so that's really where it lived. We're kind of seeing that come down a little bit, as I mentioned with the loss of ESSER funding because a lot of schools use that. So as far as as far as I'm aware, again, I've only been here a couple years, but I understand that CAST is really rode the wave, so to speak. We had a really high peak during COVID, and that's starting to come down a little bit. We're just kind of rightsizing from there. So Oh, I think you're muted. Saying we've also been trying to lean in more to some of the organizational membership that we have with things like Knowledge Alliance and STEM Ed Coalition And I don't know if are others like that that you all are part of that you found particularly useful. I mean, those are the those are the two I think we we have currently and that we more consistently, you know, engage with. You know, we're continuing to to try to engage with legislators on all you know, both sides of the aisle doing legislative visits, you know, having some talking points, having a particular position that, you know, we want to try and champion our own AI and education, etcetera. So that maybe there's some opportunities for us to do if you're in DC and doing things like that. Me: What's the value that you've seen Them: There may be some opportunities to do things like that, together would be great. Me: in general and recently with those org the coalitions or or membership organizations? Them: The one I'm most aware of, Cindy, is more tapped into the knowledge alliance but it's a lot of, you know, the volume of stuff that's whether it's the executive orders of or, you know, there's just it's been really helpful to have, like, a regular digestive information come through and some reading between the lines. And is anyone else in STEM Ed Coalition on this? Call? It doesn't sound like it. Yeah. I mean, it's a it's a it's a pretty broad mix of organizations like ours as well as professional associations for different, you know, stem fields as well as, you know, the manufacturing and a whole bunch of other sort of fields, etcetera. So it's a good range of institutions that are know, they've had Jeff Wellcome and, you know, people who are in OSTP or in the admin the prior Trump administration who you know, will be candid and have a more, you know, favorable position in terms of organizations like us and the work we've done in their monthly meetings and stuff. So that's been that's been really useful. And also, you know, some direct contacts to congressional offices to get one on one meetings and, you know, get some based not that they would refuse you, but, you know, you get quicker responses when someone like a STEM the folks at stemmed make connections. And then I don't know, Knowledge Alliance, Cindy, what you would say about when we work with them? They they have earned their key this year, honestly. Yeah. I you know, their primary, focus has been IES and, in particular, the RELs and the centers. And and they've been trying to they've been trying to they're working to expand beyond that And with everything that happened, they've you know, they're just great. And and some of it is the regular digesting and summarizing of everything that's coming out. And then there's just been a lot of very specific related to the RELs and the comp centers as they were canceled. I I I talked to the director of Knowledge Alliance every other week. Probably, she just calls me. She texts me. Like, here's the latest up I mean, it's they've been really, really helpful. And and really bringing the members together and at the same time expanding their membership. And then did you talk about ALI at all? Oh, no. That's another one. That's a good one. Yeah. Which you're gonna have to can't that number. Learning learning innovation. Learning something. Yeah. Which I never get quite right. But again, and it's just the helping digest the information. I will say that there are these organizations on the education side and there is a real lack of similar organizations on, like, the mental and behavioral health side. And and we feel that like, oh, come on. Can somebody take this on? Because we just don't have that same level of of engagement. Well, there's an organization that we belong to, but it's just it's many more members and they they just don't have the same kind of I guess, ear to the ground in and re outreach to their membership. And I will say, the work that is the strongest and has kept going for us is our health work. Like, that is that's the stuff that we've seen the least interruption in. Which is great. And those are agencies like SAMHSA, HRSA, VA. I'm trying to think of the others. Yeah. So those are some of the entities. Have folks heard recently? I mean, I know with NSF some things are moving. You know, iTest made a bunch of awards over the last some weeks, and people have been getting career awards. And I'm sure we've all been in situations where it seems like they're lining things up for October 1, at least, on this. So we have a bunch of yeah. We have a few of the couple of the NSF centers, and I just it's one of the ones that I lead, and I two program officers that's still there. And, you know, we have things like supplements that are pending. And while it's they've been very you know, unable to say anything about anything, including when, like, solicitations have come out We have heard them say, you know, October post will be able to approve things. We'll be able to approve That doesn't mean much more than that at this point. But it you know? So there's some yeah. There's some sense of movement at least on that part. So I don't know if others are Me: We have a lot pending at NSF that, you know, in a normal year would feel like Them: finding that in other program areas or with other agencies you've talked to. Me: it was ready to chug through and, you know, it's set up and sitting there to some degree. And it was sort of Them: Yeah. Me: maintaining cautious optimism about it, but it's hard to know once the clock ticks what that exactly means. Them: Yeah. We're also I'm assuming folks on the RFI the Department of Ed around AI priorities and AI definitions. Have folks seen that? Just kind of wondering where your landing in terms of responding, not responding, and then there's you know, we had a meeting about it today and I think they paused comments last week sometime and and either they're overwhelmed or they, you know, that they don't wanna publish, don't want me to read, just maybe more likely. I do you know, we didn't see any organizations like ours. I mean, the organizations can submit anonymous and, you know, maybe folks are doing that as well. And so we're sort of trying to weigh the Not that it's going to change what the department does, and necessarily, but is there some are you having that conversation? Is there some value in terms of putting a statement out there, nothing else for our colleagues and partners and other funders and who else may be looking at these looking at our advice like that. Anyway, so we're still discussing, but I was just curious. Me: Yeah. We haven't dug in on that, but Them: I can put the link in if folks haven't seen that. Me: in part because of the Them: Yeah. Me: what difference will it make unsure kind of question, maybe Them: Yeah. Me: that's advocating responsibility for in a way that's unfair. Don't know. Them: One thing we noticed too in some of the new solicitations that we've seen is that they've opened it up to a lot of different types of entities. So now for profit entities are able to apply to where they didn't they weren't before. So Yeah. That's I mean, across the board, we've seen an increase in competition with these RFPs that we're replying to I mean, everyone is looking for every scrap of funding. It was just interesting. I I curious to see how that's gonna end up in the wash, especially with the requirements for how you propose a budget. So yeah. Yeah. Ahead. I was just gonna say the other the other thing that we're scrambling we're trying to figure out right now is the turnaround time. These new RFP these new solicitations have, like, a thirty day turnaround time, whereas before we had ninety. Hell. And we also knew they were coming. So the turnaround time is much, much, much quicker. I don't know how you all were kind of handling that or dealing with that. Me: Yeah. We're processing it and dealing with the whiplash realizing that it was sort of a hurry up and wait. Turns into hurry up. Kind of question. But don't know what to do with that more than that. Them: Yeah. We're just trying to be, more nimble and streamlined in our in any of our processes. And I will say, I worked at App Associates for many years, and we got very used to it when the Department of Labor issued very, quick turnaround, like, ten days. Ten days for those, you know, $15,000,000\. I'm like, okay. Here we go. I can you know? And they were very short. So, you know, we just it's one of those things we just I think we've seen some of it along the way and some of the turnaround times getting quick So we're trying to pull from you know, staff in areas where we do have the shorter turnaround times to to help others figure out, alright. How do you do this? And still put something together and recognizing that it's not gonna look like what you used to do. It just can't. And that's everybody's in the same boat. Well, not sure what else would be useful to oh, go ahead. I have one last question. Where do all of you see hope? Like, what Great question. Yeah. You know, what is it you're like, okay. You know what? I think that this might be a helpful path forward. I mean, when I think about my work Eddie, you know, we keep waiting for all the rhetoric around workforce development turn into actual opportunities, which I think will happen. I mean, right now, the scramble is around AI and, you know, making commitments and getting someone who's out the door, etcetera. But yeah, I'm hopeful that we'll start to see more opportunities all agencies, you know, whether it's Department of Department of Labor, kind of, you know, coming together around work and CTE, etcetera or I do think there will be opportunities. They don't seem to be, you know, transpiring as fast as we need them to, but they I mean, they just have to emerge in that space, I think. So but Yeah. I think on on our front, Lindsay Jones is she's been our CEO for about three years now. She is incredible at making and building relationships, especially with foundation partners. And so we do have, you know, some general operating funds that we've received and that we will continue to receive but those conversations with other major foundations has started to come to fruition. We started to see some some work with them. And so I think honestly, they're of the same mindset. We basically are all just trying to hold on until you know, we find our moral compass again and we can get back on track. But those seem to be some of the bright spots that are really gonna carry us through to be able to continue to do our work, continue to express ourselves in the way that we need to to continue our mission. Yeah. Me: Yeah. I mean, I'm usually very optimistic. And in general, I'm Them: Chad, do you have any hope? Me: here too. I mean, it's hard to know what the you know, the ebb and flow of this is. You know, clearly, we've seen attempts to get rid of agencies and to things before, and they've never quite managed to to do it. They take a while to recover, but they don't necessarily disappear. You know, we're mostly most of our federal funding is NSF. It definitely sounds like there are folks inside that are allied and trying to do the best work they can And maintaining a culture that is trying to stay positive internally and pass around baked goods and do everything to hang on. And so I think that there's there is integrity underneath everything. And I mean, in general, people in agencies at least the ones who remain, they're used to administrations changing and what have you and presidents are temporary regardless of the the party. So, I mean, there is some level level of sort of undercurrent of this is the way things move and we always have to flow with the waves and sometimes they're bigger than others. Now the seawalls are only so high etcetera so there's lots of lots of sort of layers where the metaphor breaks down. But, but in general, I think there's you know, there are good people who are still there and they're doing everything they can to try to maintain things, and they're smart. They're holding holding the forward and things into buckets that they can recover from. I think in in a number of ways. So That I have to see as positive, I guess. It's tough. Mhmm. Complicated. At least complicated is maybe a better of saying it. Them: Well, this has been helpful. For me. I feel like it's and, again, I don't know what frequency you were doing this but I still think it would be great to just kinda connect around you know, policy related things, like, we're gonna be in DC if we wanna do something in this Massachusetts. Are having in person events, which we continue to do, we've had PI meetings, and we continue to, you know, very different different funders. We we are doing them all the time. There's an opportunity to collaborate or showcase each other's work and also like everyone else, we're doing what we can on social media and LinkedIn and you know, trying to elevate the impact of the work and the impact on communities and and yeah. So definitely, you know, retweeting, resharing, you know, liking each other's campaigns, etcetera. But if there's ever something we'd want to do together, I think that we'd all we'd you know, we'd be open to that as well. So Wonderful. I think before we were I was meeting with Sue probably every other month, and then all this stuff happened more frequent. So I think what I I do enjoy, and I think Lindsay enjoys attending these as well. So I'm I'm happy to to meet. I think the fall is getting we have lots and lots going on. But I I'm happy with whatever frequency people think is good Yeah. Monthly or bimonthly or if we wanna push it out to quarterly. Depends on what else happens next, I think. Yeah. Fair. Yeah. Thank you. Me: Yeah. When things were hot and heavy, you know, it seems like before four to four to six weeks, you know, or so is probably a good Them: We will meet and at least monthly. Since everything happened. Me: time to check back in. Them: Yeah. Yeah. And if there's anyone else that should be, I mean, I think this kind of don't know how this kinda organically grew maybe as local organizations, but and obviously, there's all kinds of things happening on signal and other, you know, much larger platforms where people are talking to each other. But does someone want to, like, maybe take on scheduling the next one? I don't know how you've done these in the past. Sue is kind of our fearless leader. So I actually took over Sue's role when I came to CAST, and so that was the connection there. But I'm happy to schedule the next one. I'll send out a doodle poll. Yeah. Like, we could rotate it and would be great. Yeah. Me: Yeah. Them: K. Alright. Well, now we can have an email. We know where we all live. So Me: Hi. Them: Yep. Yeah. I wish you all the best, and we'll be in touch. Yeah. It was nice meeting you all. Thank you so much. To see you all. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye.
