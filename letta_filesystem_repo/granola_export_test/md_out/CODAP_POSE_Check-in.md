Transcript:

Them: Log in. That I use for the regular site. Okay. And I think you get to the login. Yeah. Here. I'm gonna put a link in I'll put a link in our in our notes, actually. K. Just gonna make sure I can log in. And if I can, I'll share my screen and

Me: Hi.

Them: show you. Oh, hey, Chad. Yeah. So that worked for me. We're talking about the resource database. Snickers. Sorry. And I'm trying to remember. Is it under posts? Don't think that's it. There's The resources? So here so here's something. So just wanna show you few things. So this is where we can edit what category tags we have. So actually, I thought there would be more than I thought they would all be here. Why am I only seeing three? Oh, project types. There they are. So we have project types We have categories. We have tags. There we go. Well, no. I'm not sure what I'm looking at here. The only one that makes sense is project types. Might need to ask Ethan about that. And then fucking all projects. So it was like, we're not So, Dan, have our stickies been spent? That that were allocated from post or Pretty much. There's a there's a little bit left. There's, like, a half a sticky left. Okay. So we wanted some refinement before we were to maybe get some feedback on this or something, we could still have Ethan Yes. We could think or two. So here you can see these are here's where we could create a new project. And the project looks like it's I don't know. Never mind. Those are the example. Things. Yeah. I I I didn't look in here before. I just thought it would be more obvious when poking around. Apparently not. So I'm not sure where we add stuff because Ethan did show it to me briefly, but I think it I think it's resources. I wonder if it's resources, Dan, because I don't see that in the non staging. I mean, the actual production site. Okay. Yes. Re resources. Okay. So resource types. Those are our four. Resource disciplines. Yep. Those are the ones that we have set up. Grade bands. And standards, which we would well, the standards, I think, Well, that's interesting. I assume this would be something that someone would type. I think it is something you type, and then it will add to the to the list if you don't have it already. It suggests completions. For your for your tags. They are for our standard tags. So this is where we can set up the configuration of the page and the different filters. At least these three are are are filter types. And if we look at all resources, Yes. I believe these are the test resources that are in the database. So if we wanted to add something to the database, we'd add a new resource here. Let's look at editing one of them. Like roller coasters. Yeah. This is the these are the fields that are in our template. Right? We have a title. We have a long description, a short description, an image, Lisa, this is the assets if we wanna list, like, links and things at the bottom of the page. We have a thing. Those would be to, like, lesson plan documents or dataset Or launching the code app document or launching or link to some curriculum site or yeah, all of those things. There's the contributed by If it's a dataset, we can add these credit things. Here's where we check off those disciplines and then tags. You saw at the top. Sorry. Educational standards. If I start right now, it has one. If I start typing like, code, it should it gives me options. And if I type a new one, it will add it to the database of things. That will be presented the future entries. What would that look like, do you think, in the search? I mean, those facets, like, it will just automatically create one for every tag every standard tag that's ever been created. So when you say in the search, what what do you mean? So when somebody comes tag something with a b c one two three. And you're talking about the keyword search within the resource database or the whole site search or both? I guess I was thinking about the database search exclusively, but, yeah, I also that's a good point about the site wide search. I think it would. I think it would just find it like any other recent it's like a keyword that it would find. What about so we have the facets on like, you could filter you know, by grade band or whatever. And I if I remember right, standards was one of those filterable options. Or No. It's not. Standard is not. Just resource type, discipline, and grade band. Makes sense. This is the thing so that when someone uses a search term and they use one of these codes, then they would find that. Or know, ideally, in all of our listings, if I go to the the actual resource database. This is something I hadn't put on here, but it would be nice if these things were clickable. Right? So if I click statistics, it would sort of check check off statistics over here and then you know, dynamically modify my filter. Now I get everything that has statistics. But we don't have that. That wasn't in the mock ups, and it wasn't that was just something that just occurred to me. But, like, keyword search, if I do something like oh, let me turn off statistics. If I do something like a b c, so, yeah, I get one two three here. I don't think we have anything integrated at this level yet. Sure. No. That was an unsolved thing. We Ethan said he he thought we needed, like, a pro version of WP search then there was the question about how much that was gonna cost. Initially, we thought it was gonna be $99 a year, but then I think he said, it's gonna be $400 a year. So I told him to hold off on implementing that. At this point. So I don't have like, am unable to log in to that site. Even though I am able to log in to the WordPress regular code app website. So I can speak to Ethan to give me a login. Or can I add you? Where do I I don't I don't think I see the list of users. Or Zac, do you know where those people are? No. You're right. It would be on the left hand side if you it's right under plug ins on the which I don't see that you have either. On the production site. So you might not have whatever level of authority to do that on the staging site. Right. But I I'm in the same boat as Bill. I I'm not able to log in either. So you can't log in either? Yeah. Ethan had the he told me I he thought I would have an account. If I had one and the other one, but apparently, not. I'll reach out. I think you could create an account there, but I if I if you did, then I I'd have to see users over here to give you more permissions. Yeah. But, yeah, it looks like it's under resources. All of the stuff related to the resource database. Well, Ethan really did a nice job. I mean, I think he got a pretty high percentage, maybe 98% of the way there, at least from what we mocked up. It looks really, really good. It's great. We've got featured resources. That's one of the things you could check off. On that when you're when you're creating them? The resource. You can check off whether it should be shown in feature or not. It's nicely responsive. If I go fewer, they get smaller, and then it changes to a smaller number. Right? So that's kinda nice. We don't have related resources yet. And we we don't have contributed a resource. Because well, we have a button, that goes to a page but we have to decide what we wanna put here. How we wanna respond to somebody who wants to contribute a resource. So it's just a placeholder page right now. I'm sure that's something we can edit. In that in the set of pages. But if we want this to be more than some instructions, if we want it to be a form or something for them to upload or whatever, Yeah. We'd have to do some more development work on this page. But for the purposes of a planning grant, This is great stuff. Yeah. I I think we have a ton here for for both the pose and Cisco. Work that we proposed. Yep. So we have enough here that once we populate it, we can start going out to when I when I mean populated, I mean minimally populated Mhmm. So that we can put it in front of some people and get some feedback.

Me: Yeah. That's great.

Them: It looks slick and polished. You know, it's it ties in with the theme of the site. There are certainly a few layout things that could be tweaked over the long term. But it it yeah. He he's done a really nice job, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I gave him you know, black and white mock ups and said try and make it match you know, the color scheme. And style without any, you know, spending a lot of time on design because we just needed a prototype. But it still looks quite good. Yeah. So I'll get on there and add at least two of the data games. And if I can actually turn my attention to it, then I can think about other things to put up there. Yeah. I I think I said one of the things I was gonna add was a plug in, and Sonify would be a good one because I just finished up a tutorial. For Sonify. So I was thinking I could create a walk through video and do a little description and have assets where you know, it could load a pay you know, it it could load the tutorial. It could load a bunch of few different options there for the plug. Great. Chad, before you got here, we discussed the proposal and

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: know You are almost done. Yeah. So any any

Me: And

Them: or or

Me: I not enough updates is the the is the update. I'm I'm struggling other stuff,

Them: questions?

Me: but trying to it's it's on my, you know, top priority list this week to today and and the first couple days this week to get something spun off and ready to look at because it's like

Them: Right.

Me: due tomorrow essentially.

Them: Maybe we can brain while we're here, we could brainstorm. What are some of the things from this project that we want to highlight in the phase two proposal.

Me: Mhmm. That's good idea.

Them: So there's a list a beginning list of those, I believe.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Where is that? I'm looking for the That post phase two proposal submission plan, I'll put a link to well, I looks like there's a link on our agenda. Bill, you got a little section at the bottom of that of phase one Then we just have a few things at this point, but that's a good start. Oh, yeah. The ingredients from fast work? Yep. Yeah. So maybe we can expand on this a little bit. I don't know if we have, like do we have a document that pulls together our gleanings from our interviews I thought we had something like that somewhere.

Me: I think we do

Them: Yeah. We surely do. We have that notebook l n page. Mhmm. That's a good point. You can query it for what are what are five things that we should use in a proposal You know, it it's a chatbot. So Mhmm. Well, maybe maybe some of what we could do Chad, is to in support of the getting this thing in. We try and flush out important points. For the proposal regarding the phase one works.

Me: Mhmm. And and

Them: Just trying to

Me: getting what in you said? Right.

Them: actually put details here as opposed to, like,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: what You know, a few bullet points. Just to help support writing whatever that section is gonna be. It should be about, you know, what we learned in phase one that we wanna

Me: Right.

Them: plan to address in phase two or something like

Me: Exactly. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: And, you know, talking about our activities, of course, the ICORE active you know, interviews, conference focus groups, the you know, the the day to day interactions with other projects that we're working with and even some sort of freelance. We we can we can talk about it. Maybe we can talk talk about the experiments with professional learning paid professional learning

Me: Right. Trying to look at the goals and other documents from the original proposal too to see if that helps us. So I can't find right off the top right off the bat either, but

Them: So I asked it for five takeaways. I'll paste them into that document.

Me: First, It's hard to find a successful narrative Oh, there it is. Okay. Alright. Identify scope and engage the user community. Potential for establishing new user community, Test distributed development infrastructure. Identify organizational governance and coordination models, explore sustainable ecosystem avenues, We've done a little bit with professional development, We've gotten foundation support. So we should be able to describe that. The Cisco proposal is something that is a successful outcome of pose one. For framing it. Like that. So those are some examples of things that we've done. You know, things that we I mean, presentations at and, I mean, and coordination at DOC k twelve and other kinds of places or cases where we've reached out to the user community and helped you define it and identify opportunities, plug in development and cases where we've, you know, worked with people on plug ins. Know, across different levels of people's expertise is, you know those are all trial runs for the sort of thing that Pose two needs to do regularly. I'm not sure what we've done with establishing new user communities necessarily.

Them: Don't know. We certainly have done We've done a couple of presentations. You know, the it's not astronomy. I'm trying to think Based on the yeah. The space educator. Yeah. And the the data center Josh ratios, program. Dan, you just gave a training with that Tri State Alliance. Is that right? Was that science teachers, or who was that? Yeah. K. Maybe that's not really a new user community, but you're saying necessarily a new user community. But middle school teachers in Washington, instructors through that

Me: Those were community college, weren't they?

Them: State thing. Did you mention that already? Community college. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. So that's definitely new user community, for example.

Them: Is anybody writing these things down?

Me: Granola's cap granola's catching them, but yeah.

Them: It's starting right now. There's an extent to which the Esteem Summit which I went to, established pre service mass stat ed educators as a a definable community.

Me: I think so. Yeah. Rob was at the the messy data coalition call and seemed to echo that sense as well. I think that's definitely a separate entity. And and we should recognize that you know, just because you know, we may not feel like we were the ones presenting doesn't mean that there was not evidence being established. In fact, if other people were doing things with CodeApp with different communities. We should consider that, you know, stronger evidence in some ways. Because we weren't the nexus of it. So has there been activity in different communities that we know of that provides us a signal that there's there there. Right?

Them: Well, when we were at NCTM, there were certainly several codep presentations that weren't us.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So there's that. There's also I was gonna say the I guess, I wonder about, you know, can we claim collaborations with the data goats or data PBL like, those feel like different communities than we have typically worked with.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Right?

Me: Definitely. I mean those are potential user communities in some ways or you know, engaging current community in other ways. Mhmm.

Them: Sort of athletics, you know, physical education. We need to break into the what's what's that group you mentioned? So, like, fantasy sports?

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: There must be fantasy sports people who

Me: Mhmm.

Them: spend all their time staring at spreadsheets. Right, who would probably appreciate a little more dynamic tool.

Me: Yeah.

Them: But we haven't made that link yet.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. There are definitely untapped communities, education communities as well. So so there's a list there. Of communities that we have engaged additional ones, There's a list of engagement that we've done I mean, list to be had of engagement that we've done with in, you know, the understood communities already. We should figure out how to identify those types of activities. Now that we're trying to take the whole thing and make a proposal on annual report, but we definitely

Them: Oh,

Me: would need evidence that we have done phase one stuff. Right?

Them: yeah. I mean, through demos, I've worked with community science communities.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I certainly think that you know, that's a a ripe area for us to continue to push into if we identify big sites who are doing community science,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: who don't have, like, a download as code app kind of thing. That we should try and work with them to

Me: Yes.

Them: get

Me: Mhmm.

Them: codep as as as a tool option. For their users to to do the analysis.

Me: Mhmm. Yes.

Them: Chad, is there any risk of you know, if we detail Here are these dozen different user communities that we presented to, that we've engaged with, is there any risk of in the proposal, spelling all that out and they say, why don't these guys need our help? They've already they've already done the work, or they already know how to do the They don't need support to do this.

Me: I don't think so. I mean, I think we frame them as categories of know, opportunity. You know, basically,

Them: Yeah.

Me: we're saying we've done the work to discover these categories of potential users. We haven't know, expanded to them. We we we know the sorts of things they be interested in much better than we did, you know, a year ago.

Them: We don't have the organization. That is

Me: Right.

Them: the product of a phase two. And it's to our advantage to show that we've taken the initiative and gone out and tried this, you know, tried our shtick with these people and learned from it and refining it and are excited to do more work if only we had the funds to do so.

Me: We've identified there's potential for a much larger user base in lots of

Them: Yeah.

Me: categories than we have been able to tap. And if they don't fund us, then we will it will remain untapped. Yeah. No.

Them: And if what larger community that will make it possible for CodeApp to become a sustainable open source ecosystem? We continue to expand certainly wanna highlight that the exponential growth has not eased up yet.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: We haven't we haven't hit the s curve You know?

Me: Hi.

Them: Top of that. S curve. Yeah. At some point, there has to be something like that. But we're still in early stages of expansion.

Me: Right. One of the things that we have done without sort of recognizing it within this, but is establish codified ways of working with, and developer community on core code app. You know, a year and some ago, there were many fewer internal developers who were familiar with the core codap development I think think, Bill, you can just correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's fair to say that that the central pole of codap development was not as inculcated with the usual sorts of development practices that we're to with collaborative development. I mean, if two years ago if we decided to say, ah, we're going to have seven external developers working on this and you just got a pull request, I kinda feel like you could You know? Whereas now, like, we're in a better, like, okay. Point to these Jira stories. There's a poll request. There's a something. Here's a mean, I think we I mean, that's that's actually a really important part of what they're looking for is is this ready to be an open source project for the world to engage with?

Them: I agree.

Me: Mhmm. And so that's something that we can we can hold up the good of our we can say this story, we can say this funny, you know, into developers. We've been hot housing this with you know, highly collaborative, experienced team. But also, you know, had some external developers engaging in ways x, y, and z

Them: I went to the I I don't know if we wanna put this on here anywhere, but you know, I went to the All Things Open conference. And presented an unconference workshop, you know, not workshop, kinda roundtable discussion about governance and issues or on how to create

Me: Mhmm.

Them: trust and those kinds of things. So I don't if that's something that

Me: Yeah. Definitely.

Them: put in here. It's activities that

Me: Yeah. I think so.

Them: that we've done

Me: The I I keep mentioning it in some of these conversations. But I am realizing that we should be codifying it I think there are and put this out there to see if we can put some meat on the bones. I think there are now several different examples of plug in developers across a continuum of expertise or experience. In other words, I think we have people who are I mean, the brown folks maybe was a little bit before this, but, you know, people who are very into developing collaborative code who have taken and run with plug ins. And, you know, Taco is probably somewhere along the in the middle of the range. Tim's arguably somewhere along the middle of the range too. You know, Andrew Ross has spent you know, the last month and a half or two developing things that are codap plugins. Without checking in with us, but, you know, barely knows how to use GitHub. He just plugs away on his own computer. You know? So and there's a may think I think there might be opportunities for us to say, we have we have evidence that people with interest and expertise in their own domain can engage with and create plug ins. You know, and they don't have to be expert developers We think we are tapping into something that's a bigger, you know, vein. To be had here. And maybe

Them: Well, we should cert oh, I was gonna say we should certainly cite the work that's been done

Me: right. Exactly. I think we're site site to work

Them: to make it easier for people to do the

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Yep. Exactly. And and cite examples of the kinds of plugins both as examples of the diversity of plugins that we built and examples of the multiple entry points of new experience that we've been able to activate. And we should, yeah, we should certainly get a significant list of the plugins that people have developed. And, you know, internally, too yes, you're right, Phil. Sorry. Internally too, you know, the in the work of the DSC project. You know? Were code app plugins that were very sophisticated codec plugins, but and they were developed internally. But, you know, that's a different different level of plug in than okay. It's a variation on a pull down menu theme or what have you. And on the other side, I developed another plug in for NetApp, you know, that was just a variation on a theme in my own spare time or what have you. So, like, we should we should really make a big deal about the fact that open source, you know, has let us develop a a real meaningful community without even trying. Or no. Pizzas. Oh, it's all all our doing. We try hard.

Them: Well, I do think I do I do think we can certainly that we've expanded the community of developers both internally in terms of understanding the code base and externally in terms of plug in contributors And internally, we have worked on procedures for how people can contribute, will inform you know, the additional developers who will be we hope to expand to outside, especially with the new architecture that we think will support external development

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So that's another thing to mention. And that we've, you know, created resources that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that will facilitate the growing community of plug in developers. So all of those pieces, I think, work toward you know? So how so coming back to Bill's point earlier, what we need is an organization that is focused on this. This grant has helped us have some of that focused time. This initial planning grant, but we need to work toward the sustainable not just community, but organization that will facilitate the the the sustainability of the

Me: Yeah. We we've set the table.

Them: of this work into the future.

Me: You know? Like, if you wanted to develop if you wanted to contribute a you know, fill in the blank. Wanna contribute a resource? You wanna contribute a plug in? Know? Or you you wanna contribute a plug in, but you don't not quite sure? You wanna, you know, contribute to the core code of CodeApp you know, we have laid the groundwork for all those things to happen. And right now, if you come to us and say, I want to do that, all we can do is say, oh, great. You know? Hopefully, you can yeah. I think there's a page that describes that somewhere. Let me know if you succeed. Because we don't have an organization that is well equipped to, you know, outfitted to accept that. And orchestrate and make sure that we say, oh, and could your friend also do one of those? You know? Right. Mhmm.

Them: Another thing to add is we've had at least we've had two just in the last month, two new translations of CodeApp. One into Dutch and one into French. So I don't know if we had other new ones in this past year that we can claim support of? I'm not sure. Can you remember, Bill? I don't think so. But two new translations is not bad.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I mean, one thing one yeah. I do think that it's not as easy to sort of there's part of me that wants to push the button in PO editor for, like, auto translate, you know, AI auto translate stuff. But I do think that the context of these short phrases makes it potentially difficult to translate a chunk of this stuff in a way that would make sense for a native speaker trying to use the app.

Me: Well, yes, at same time, you don't underestimate the know what the right phenomenon is. The fill in the blank phenomenon, the Wordle phenomenon, call it what we will, that like, having potential translations in 75 languages that are almost right but not quite have big signs on them saying, you know, do you speak?

Them: Help us refine this.

Me: Malaysian, please fix this, you know, kind of thing or check off the box or You know, there's a lot to be said for that as opposed to start from scratch.

Them: Yeah. I mean, that could be a a step that we move.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Toward. In the thing or even, you you know, we say, would you be you know, if we have a preliminary tran you know, are you saying put out the preliminary translation of, like, a little

Me: I'm saying that's a strategy.

Them: icon or flag? Many

Me: Like or tactic. The strategy that we might highlight into something is, like because they're, they'll be asking how to use it. Like, one one of the ways we do it is we're gonna you know, we are going to provide you know, scaffolded opportunities for, you know, speakers to contribute you know, finalized translations. By, you know, scaffolding partial trans you know, partial unbedded translations that, you know, community members can you know, agree to and finalize or something like that.

Them: Right. My guess is PO editor just takes phrases and sends them to to an AI translator. I wonder if we would get better results if we basically took in LLM, fed it all the help pages for Kodap, told them about what Kodap does. And then said, here's a

Me: Yeah. Either

Them: here's a list. Ring. Ring. Blade it.

Me: either way, I'm just I'm just saying, like, a a table of, like, a pull down and choose your your language. Okay? Indonesian. Now you know, here's a table. Can you, you know, log in we know who you are? Check yes. Yes. Yes. I don't think so. Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't think

Them: Well, they wouldn't even have to do that.

Me: so. You know? And now we just pull up the I don't think so. It's right. Mhmm.

Them: They could just scroll through it, and then anything that doesn't look right, they update.

Me: Right. No. That that's what I mean. Exactly. But, you know, some some way of of some sort of crowdsource vetting of that. Main point being, thought about this. We're using AI. Using it as an opportunity to pull in more people in the community. And as soon as we get Indonesian checked off, you know, all the way down the list, then we're gonna open it up to Indonesia. Mhmm.

Them: Anyway, we've had some additional translations in the past year. We anticipate there will be more coming and you know, at least at this point, we have a process. For how to how to do that. If someone wants to translate then

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, we have successfully guided nonprogrammers, people who are just wanna help. Into doing that. Thing, and it's relatively straightforward.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Except for building codec. But other than that,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's really easier too. And Andrew Ross is another data point for that. Is that

Me: These more kind of plug ins.

Them: true? He's been working on a it's good.

Me: And with the little experience and guidance. And, you know, doing relatively well at it. And

Them: What kind of plug ins is he working in?

Me: he's working on a plug in to do multivariable correlation charts.

Them: Alright. Right.

Me: Yep.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Cross correlation charts. So 15 seven by seven, you know, scatter plots of different variables and what correlates with what.

Them: Do we know if he's made any progress on that? Or

Me: What. Yeah. Lots. Yeah. I know he's got them all working. He's having issues. As I was telling Bill, positioning in, you know, 25 individual graphs in codap v three. As we don't have an API for positioning graphs as well, you know, out and document, but he's you know, going great guns and in v two right now. Yeah. And with little you know, I I helped him get started in Cursor, which, you know, moved him a little bit faster along decently faster along than he'd been doing. But even before that, was already digging in on his own. And And it was

Them: And we certainly should see you know, a Bill and I on on AI day, we tried to explore at least at that time. Could we make you know, a a a code app a a a plugin builder

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Now we said do

Them: Wasn't quite ready at that time, but we're getting closer and closer.

Me: what's well it's well well on it. I mean, it's entirely ready essentially now. I mean, and that's another piece, by the way. You know, we Scott, has developed because we wanted to for internal development, a full starter plugin that, you know, works effectively within our environment with good instructions, etcetera, with Playwright and, you know, other tests.

Them: You mean, the React plugin that

Me: So that's more of the simple yeah. There's a there's a starter plug in that, you know, is is

Them: that starter

Me: robust and and has full sort of testing capability and build and

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: and what have you. And that's this smoke test distributed development infrastructure that we said we were gonna build. So, yeah, that's more of the same Mhmm. And, yeah, you've got examples of lung chain. I've got a full m compatible that can run code app from you know, Claude. So there are lots of of things that we even know that we've developed here that we need to claim lay claim to.

Them: What do you mean can run Claudette?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: From Claude?

Me: I can, I can open my cloud desk

Them: You haven't shown him that yet?

Me: desktop? No. I I I don't think I have I've I've I get onto other projects that haven't shown either. I'm finalized these things for you. Yeah. Now I can open up cloud desktop and say, please make a graph of x, y, and z. Thank you. You know, add a table. Now pull in some data from somewhere and send that into, you know, to join in with this table. Basically, can do all the the I've got

Them: Yeah. Blind collab.

Me: what's that? Yeah. Yeah. I've I've I've got an AI driven code app know, engine, essentially. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. It works. He he basically using an MCP server, he can send a a special an I a unique code from a codab document. To Claude, and then Claude can communicate with the codab document. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. It's a little

Them: I sent this stuff to do it, but it never worked for me.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Chad demoed it for me, and I was pretty

Me: That was just a problem It was it was it was it was in that case. But it's still it's it's pretty strong now. I haven't used it for a while, so I'm sure it's got a little bit that needs to be refined. But it's probably it's easier to set up in clog and other things now than it was three weeks ago because they keep on improving their setup. Main point being, can claim that both as a as plug in development you know, success and, you know, development process success. And it's a tool that could be available for the world People want to run CodeUp from you know, drive it, but with you name it. You you wanna drive it with your LLM. You wanna drive it with n a n. You wanna drive it with something else. You know, it's very available. So that should open up more innovation. So we and we should claim those things. You know? That and the the work as examples of how, you know, we are providing infrastructure for people to innovate with Kodap using AI tools. Know, and, you know, things that are well, rules, documents that are up for developing within cursor and AI IDEs. And line chain, MCP, you know, those kinds of things. I think we want a section that says we're

Them: Yeah. Given given the I hadn't really about that before, but given the the executive order priorities explaining how this is how we have examples of AI integration.

Me: Yeah. Both AI integration and

Them: I've formed a

Me: AI, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: facilitated development, you know, that we are

Them: Both of those things. Any anything AI, even if it's

Me: yep. Mhmm.

Them: tangential. As long as it's not accessibility.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Well, one of our plans is to

Them: And

Me: you know, to add that in this next piece is

Them: Keep that hush\-hush. It's it's unclear what what is what counts or not. Maybe it's just idiosyncratic depending on

Me: Accessibility is for everyone.

Them: which idiot person is

Me: Yeah.

Them: is doing the political filtering. You know, in theory, accessibility is on the chopping block. But they didn't I guess, maybe the AI canceled the accessibility and device thing. I mean, there's there was a new enchant know if you have a few minutes after this meeting I wanna talk to you about. There's a a new RFP. It's due September 11\. I had a conversation with somebody with Nam Sue today about submitting

Me: As I said, is that for

Them: something wanna talk to you about it. And the whole branding impact section is identical. It's like it has a section saying where we want to broaden purchase in particular by women and underrepresented groups and blah blah blah. It's just I'm like, are they kidding?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: No. HRAP. Yeah. They want you to they they want you to write a proposal that they can just

Me: Right.

Them: cancel based on other criteria. I was so it's so frustrating. And it it's

Me: Well,

Them: like this RFP hasn't been modified. It it talks about the president's, you know, or whatever the the the priorities, the new priorities and AI. There's a whole thing in there about I don't know how are they are gonna enforce this. But of the executive orders is that any federal money that's spent on stuff all that stuff has to be manufactured in The US.

Me: Alright. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: So I'm supposed like, anytime we buy, like, a stapler or you know, a computer, How many of those are manufactured here?

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: Is anyway. So that stuff was in this RFP. In addition to all those other things where it's like, you know, make sure you design something that will broaden impacts to women in underrepresented accessibility was cited as a specific issue. Anyway, and then there were other emphasis m on geography in a separate paragraph in a different place, an EPS score.

Me: What's the well, you can tell me later what the I'll I'll find out as we go.

Them: Yep.

Me: I think so. Yes. I think

Them: So is this helpful, Chad, in terms

Me: we wanna find, you know, some concrete examples of some of these things. I think we, you know, as we were just talking about, I think we want to be clear. I think we want an AI section in way, shape, form that has a couple different layers to it including that we're you know, all the ways we're using AI, we're using AI to, you know, make it to lower the threshold. For people to, contribute We're using AI to open up innovation and make it possible for people to do different kinds of things so that we can open up the community using AI to do development ourselves and it's etcetera. And using AI know, we we will if you fund us, use AI to accessibility so that the community can be even larger, you know, all those things.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Alright. I think we are overtime actually by three minutes. I do have

Me: Okay.

Them: an NCTM proposal that's due midnight at Pacific time, Bill.

Me: Well,

Them: It's midnight Pacific. So

Me: I thought you're set.

Them: I have till three in the morning to get it in, and you have until midnight to stay up with me.

Me: Say, go go take a nap.

Them: And so It really get that. That time. What's that? I will not be awake at midnight Pacific.

Me: Right.

Them: So I have slightly less time than I think I have. Just to tell you, my my initial brainstormed title is using a free tool to engage students in modeling through data from algebra to geometry to statistics.

Me: Sounds well. Search optimized

Them: I guess so. It's it's exactly a 100 characters, which is what we're limited to.

Me: Perfect.

Them: But I I just wanna, like, get a sense of, like, is that the workshop we wanna present? I I think the search tool up optimization is more important at this stage. Okay. So when people are looking through their their the the the the thing for sections to go to, they'll find data. They'll find algebra, geometry, modeling, statistics, They'll find well, Yeah. Okay. Long as they don't turn into a skeptic. That's not possible.

Me: Right. Well, you've got you do get a couple sentences below that, so you say the right words in that.

Them: Yeah. There's a 500 character

Me: You have to choose an audience

Them: description And

Me: level.

Them: yeah, I picked nine to 12\.

Me: Probably right.

Them: I mean, I could one option is general interest.

Me: Yeah. That's only good. I think nine to 12 is probably better. I think you're gonna get people who tune in to modeling

Them: Yeah.

Me: Usually, say say algebra somewhere in there or something.

Them: But there's a 500 description. There's a 1,000 character participant learning. Describing outcomes and how time will be allocated. There's a focus on math. Identify key mathematics content. And how need your help, Bill. Yeah. Interactive workshop description, 750 characters, which describe planned activities seems totally overlapping with describe learning outcomes and how the time will be allocated. But and then topics think oh, there's a thousand character describe alignment NCTM's equity position. I think I have an idea of what to put there. Do we have any MCTM books, journals? Articles, I don't think we do. You might know. What what do you mean? They it says NCTM publications. Limited to 500 characters. List authored NCTM books slash journals or state no. That are relevant I don't know. I I think they wanna know if you've done if I whoever I'm suggesting Bill and I go. If we get accepted. So they're looking for relevant or maybe not even relevant, just interaction with NCTM through articles and books. Nothing is coming to mind. Okay. And then I might there's a thing on speaking experience. Describe up to three recent relevant experiences. So I can put them tristate Science Alliance thing in there. Perhaps some other stuff, but we should put a few things in there. So there's do to get this done. I'll try and get a draft of stuff and then Bill, if you can help me finish it up, polish it off, that would be good. So I just asked Chad GPT and it's come up with some math teacher articles. And that teacher stuff. In the summary. That you've done? No. I didn't ask it No. No. That's why I think they wanna know author that that we have authored. They wanna know what the speakers

Me: You'd probably know if you'd done something for an NCTM journal

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I don't think we have. At least I know I haven't. I thought maybe you or it's just the two of us, that's the only two people they care about. Okay. Well, I'm gonna Chad, I wanna talk to you about this

Me: Sure.

Them: Joel, other submission and then I'll work on this thing. Alright. See you guys.

Me: Alright.

Them: Okay.

Me: Take care. Thanks.

Them: Try to make you the host then just so when I jump off. Yep. Thanks. Okay. See you guys.

Me: Thanks.

Them: So, Chad,

Me: Alright. Team. So what is this called, the competition?

Them: so it's computer and information science and engineering. Future

Me: Yep. Right. Yeah. Okay.

Them: reading,

Me: Yeah. It is it's the yeah. Okay. So it's the core the core future thing under computing education

Them: core. Yes.

Me: one. Right? Mhmm. It's the program call from size. Mhmm.

Them: So

Me: Yep.

Them: September 11 is the target date, same as the pose. And then they list another target date. February 5\.

Me: Mhmm. It's hard to figure out exactly

Them: And under that, it says, well, proposals are accepted

Me: Yeah.

Them: anytime. Proposals are

Me: Yeah. This is

Them: encouraged to submit by target dates to

Me: this is size size's usual mode. We're not used to size, but they they are used to program calls in this way. This is a much bigger one than they usually put together because they jammed everything into one. But

Them: Right. So this one has an estimated number of awards of

Me: Yeah. Alright. 400, 600\.

Them: 100 to 600\.

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: Now it is spread across, you know,

Me: Yeah.

Them: 10 different programs. So maybe 40 to 50 awards per program,

Me: Yeah.

Them: That's still high. It seems. And I was already in conversations with Nam Sue about doing something with SageModeler around computational thinking. And we talked about maybe doing something early grades You know? So this is a way of engaging students in a in early grade to begin thinking about how do you break down a problem understanding it from a computational perspective. Because if you're gonna build a model, a system model of it, or a simulation of it, then you need to start thinking about what are my calculable components.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: Things like that. So we would do we'd target, like, third, fourth grade maybe. Looking at she says that she basically has So in her EIR, she has talked to Alabama as we talked about.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I said, well, they would have had to have a collaborative partner for that to count as an EPSCoR thing.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: She said, yes. I got them registered. I talked them through how to do all the NSF

Me: Who who at Alabama?

Them: work paperwork. And so

Me: Mhmm.

Them: some superintendent in Alabama, if not

Me: How? Okay.

Them: more, Basically, they're going to be recruiting WestEd is, in fact, doing the recruiting for this EIR. All they're recruiting from all fourth grade elementary classes in Alabama, of which apparently there are

Me: Okay.

Them: only a 160\. But she says that there's a particular district Phoenix. Like, they're for the EAR, they're focusing on rural. In Phoenix, Alabama is apparently less rural. I don't know. It's they have nine elementary schools.

Me: Okay.

Them: And she said that she has worked that that she could get them it's likely that she could get them on board like, immediately, and they could be a collaborative partner So they would be one of the PIs.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And that would give us a you know, red EPS score state. That we could work with. And so then, again, it's not that much. It's a maximum of a million dollars. Over four years.

Me: There is a solicitation. I didn't see it. Oh, yeah. It's a million dollars essentially. Yep.

Them: Million dollars over four years. They say, typically, a 150 to 250 k per year. Discouraged from exceeding 300 in any single year. So if we did four years, $2\.50 k per year, it doesn't leave a lot of money for for the work, especially if we're splitting it between Concord MSU, and the school district.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I think what we end up doing with the school district is mostly, like, here's money for professional learning time for teachers, and stipends for their participation. So that money would all go there. Nam Sue and maybe a postdoc with Nam Sue would would be a data collection and analysis. And then our end would be working with teachers to develop, you know, curriculum integrated working with them to integrate into their existing curriculum. And, potentially, I said, you know, if we're looking at how early can we do this, we don't know if they're using you know, Chromebooks or iPads or whatever that we would do you know, we we would build in a little bit of there's can't be a lot of tech money in this. So but we build a

Me: And then

Them: little tech money to make sure we could address any issues related to the devices used by younger

Me: Mhmm.

Them: students make sure that software would work.

Me: Yep.

Them: And so then then it's about how young can you begin to support students and thinking from a computational thinking perspective, using a tool that that will help them to stay within context of what they're learning about Right? Because you're modeling you're modeling systems, whatever that is. It could be know, we could stay focused on science or we could do science and social studies maybe even.

Me: Yeah. Depending upon what they care about in this, but they may not care that much it's computing education. So, yep,

Them: Yeah. And it's and, again, if it's third, fourth grade, I'm not sure how much time they spend on

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, either of those topics. It's not math and English.

Me: Right.

Them: Apoliteracy. Right? And the other argument

Me: Yeah. I would say I would say, you know, the way to we went over teachers at that level would be to to a literacy, you know, connection and to take books and model those books. Now you may have already done this, so I think it was something. But but that's, you know, obviously a way to win the teachers over. Whether it's the way to win reviewers over, I don't know.

Them: Yeah. We talked about that, but then I feel like we need a literacy expert of some kind, which

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: we'd have to bring on somebody else. If we're gonna do

Me: Right. Sure.

Them: just the the the science of the mod

Me: Mhmm.

Them: It's not just can we make a model of the story in this book.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: Right? If you wanna make a literacy connection, we have to argue why doing the activities that we're planning to do in the way that we're planning to do them will help boost literacy. And

Me: Right. I I to be clear, I don't know that you need to do that as much as saying, basically, if you can make connections to to books, then teachers have an excuse to do the thing. You know, like there's you know, there are people who have made good hay in science, you know, by taking that book that everybody loves to read and, you know, doing a science lesson around the apples that grow in the orchard that the main character love or something. Right? And So but I don't know if that's the right slant for this necessarily.

Them: And certainly, Department of Ed would care more about literacy than NSF would.

Me: I think the slant might be we're gonna like, here are four different ways that we think that this tool will help teachers at elementary level bring kids into using it. And every time they're using it, are doing computing. So we'll look for connections with, you know, popular books that they're reading. We will look for connections to theirs. Know, you basically, because they don't care as long as the kids are competing. Right? That's what matters to to them.

Them: I guess that's true. And then we could say, you know, we're gonna look across disciplines for opportunities to engage students in you know, modeling and computational thinking. And here are examples of how this could be done in English, social studies, science. And

Me: Yep. Transformative projects inform our understanding of the effective teaching and learning of computing skills and concepts. At all levels, to contribute to the development of pathways toward a robust workforce while

Them: Right.

Me: preparing for careers. So we're looking for ways that teaching and learning of computing skills and concepts can happen at the

Them: Yeah.

Me: fourth grade level. Mhmm.

Them: So then the question, if we wanna move forward with this, here are the options. We work with this Alabama district that Nam Sue already has a connection with.

Me: Sir?

Them: Another option would be that we try and bring on Wyoming. Because that's you know, we have Emile is out there, and he was on the building the MCM project and he's excited about system modeling stuff. But that would end up bringing on I mean,

Me: That's another that's a that's a significant partner, and then you got four over here.

Them: so the pro is a temp score. Wyoming, if the significant partner splits the money,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: even smaller.

Me: Yep.

Them: The other option would be Rhode Island is an

Me: Mhmm.

Them: CoR state. And we have a lot of connections into Rhode Island right now, especially you know, where I just did this conference and and the head of the of Rista plus other other important people in RISTA. And and Providence. Whatnot. And so but the thing is in order again, in order for it to count as an EPS score,

Me: You gotta have a you gotta have somebody in the island actually, yeah, connecting. Mhmm.

Them: part they'd have to be a collaborative part. And they have to be able to handle the NSF side of

Me: Right.

Them: receiving money and doing paperwork.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Which

Me: Yep.

Them: we're going for September 11 as our target date, that's not gonna happen. But between

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: so the quest

Me: Does does Nancy think that this Alabama partner could play between now and September 11?

Them: She seems to think so.

Me: Okay.

Them: Because she's already in contact with them a lot about the I EIR and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: they know how to do the she walked them through all the paperwork. So she thinks that they could but we were trying to decide Alabama, Rhode Island, Wyoming,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: thought I would talk to you about it. Get your take. It seems like if we wanna do something quickly, within our funding,

Me: Right.

Them: let that Alabama might be the only option.

Me: Seem it seems like it. I mean, I think I think you know, it's ironic that the that working with the loan school district is the you know, to get them to sign up for some arcane thing is the fastest option. But I think you're right. I mean, by the time even if you're going to Wyoming, by the time you work that through and then their office and then is it really that and to money, you know, it's all it's it's actually more complicated in some ways. You know, if the Wyoming if the Alabama folks agree, then it's a much simpler project.

Them: Right.

Me: And you know, and you could say it's, you know, co design, etcetera, etcetera, and, you know, lots of lots of ways that that could be valuable. And especially if you've got lots of fourth graders, I mean, think that's very compelling, I don't know what the level of truth of that

Them: If they have nine elementary schools, this I don't I don't know how many there are per school. I can look it up. It's Phoenix it's Phoenix, Alabama as the district.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So and I think we can't I mean, also don't know how many teachers we could work with. We were talking about, like, 10\.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Teachers.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: We can get 10 teachers across nine elementary schools.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I think that will probably be enough If we could get I mean I mean, I don't know. If there's only nine well, no. Because in elementary it was it was fourth grade. So how many fourth grade teachers would there be? Maybe they're even if there were only one per school, then we would get nine. But I was thinking I I was actually thinking that we try and do third and fourth

Me: So

Them: like, trying to push

Me: mhmm.

Them: of how young we could go. And see and see if you, you know, where where it works, where it doesn't work. If we really wanna do that, then we might say we would

Me: So the yeah. For

Them: import across.

Me: Proplexity says probably 30 or so. There are a hundred and hundred and seventy seven point eight nine elementary classroom teachers in k five. And Phoenix. So probably there are probably a couple dozen fourth grade teachers. But that's 10, 12, and a half to fourth grade teachers or something isn't bad. Or you could imagine engaging them all in some way

Them: Right.

Me: shape, or form within, you know, workshop or something, and then

Them: Yeah. If we could form even, like, I don't know how coordinated their curriculum is. But if, you know, we have like, someone says, I'll do the such and such unit. Model, and I'll do the such you know, like, we could

Me: Right.

Them: form subgroups of people who can then share them amongst the larger groups.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yep. Yeah. And some kind of a community practice and sharing across schools and whatever and yeah.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. I think there's a big possibility. And, you know, I think I think if they're there and ready to go, then that's probably the only feasible way to make it happen on that time frame anyway. But that sounds great. And and I think the I think the generic applicability of the SageModeler is the thing to lean on there. You know, you've gotta gotta make the argument that it's computing and computational thinking, which you know, takes a little bit of of, you know, artwork there. But but there's no question that you can know, what are you teaching tomorrow? Okay. I I'll find a way to get SageModeler to work with it. It's you know, most of the time, you can find something Mhmm. So that's that's a huge argument for making this happen. Wherever teachers are willing. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. So you're supportive of

Me: Yeah.

Them: this? Do you think I should try and hit the September 11 deadline?

Me: I think if Nam Sue is crazy enough to do it, then we should strive for it. You know, I think

Them: Again, they're they're only, quote, target dates.

Me: yeah. Exactly.

Them: So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: even if we didn't get it in by exactly the eleventh, if we got it a few days later, it's gonna be in the same pile of stuff that they're

Me: Probably true. Yeah. I don't exactly know how it works. And these days, who knows?

Them: recruit I k.

Me: What it all means? So, yes, definitely. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: And and just

Me: That seems that seems doable.

Them: MSU, Us, and Alabama for now. Okay.

Me: Think. Yeah.

Them: Alright. I'll let let him know.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. That

Them: Start moving.

Me: yep. That's good. Now we're thinking about these all. Was you know, I'm starting to take stock in general. Talk with us a little bit tomorrow. I'm trying to get you groups of you know, subgroups of people that think about ideas overall. One thing that

Them: What

Me: you know, I realized, you know, we you know, a few of us who were reviewing these at the end of last week realized is that the core proposals are the ones that are up, you know, next in relative you know, soon. October 2 is, ECR core, EDU core. And that's one that we're sitting on, what, four excellent two excellent three two very goods. I mean, the the rates one was reviewed

Them: Well, that was it was highly competitive. It was one excellent and three very good.

Me: very well. Yeah. But still, I mean, that's that's not something we should be throwing in the dustbin, especially if we can, you know, dump too many changes and and put it in because

Them: Yeah.

Me: we should advantage of every opportunity we have. So that was just something that occurred to me. Mhmm.

Them: Right. I mean, the the the we yeah. Looking at what the what the weaknesses were, we may be able to address those.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And see what because, again, it wasn't an AI proposal, though.

Me: Right. Exactly. But, but it's still still had a lot of strength, so we can think about that. And, you know, if we wanna tilt it a little bit, that's fine. But, you know, if we don't have to make a lot of changes, then we can submit it and then put our energy into another one, you know, all the better. So anyway, just just a thought that I was realizing we should

Them: Yep.

Me: take advantage of everything that's good and realize that October 2 is sooner than sorry. As soon as September 11, but it's sooner than November 12\. So

Them: Yep. I know that Lynn is interested in in doing something like what the beam group is doing.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: More more supportive on you know, scaffolding

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: naive model builders naive system thinkers, So we've been starting to think about that some.

Me: Yeah. That's good as well.

Them: I do think that that's, like that would be a good angle to

Me: Mhmm.
