Transcript:

Them: Alright. Was sent out for people to test the Dutch version of SageModeler

Me: Nice.

Them: slash and the French version of Coda.

Me: Nice. That's awesome. Oh, we didn't have a French version. That's great.

Them: We kinda rent for you.

Me: Cool. Oh, even with all the Canadians in the world. Opens up an entire market north of the Fortinet Ferry Cool. So welcome back. Were you away or just off? I was I've lost track of who's on vacation, where, and when.

Them: I was I was away from basically Friday through Tuesday. And then, I was back yesterday. I've been up feeling great in the afternoon, so I was off, like, half a day there.

Me: Yeah. Uh\-huh.

Them: I just finished the SIDZY sonification

Me: Nice.

Them: tutorial, which I sent off to Jacob to review. And here we are.

Me: Cool. That's great. Let's see. Let me check my notes to see if there's something separate, but coming up to speed, I Yeah. So the one minor thing I have is that Leslie was like, that's all I know. Do you know about Kathy's comment about Was there an email message that had any more context than Rista data or risk to AI? I mean, was it

Them: No.

Me: don't know if it's a presentation or a symposium or, like, they just want another session or

Them: I think Kathy is just doing her championing of

Me: Okay.

Them: you know, AI data science whatever. And I I can't tell if she's actually just on her own saying, hey. Great if we had some of these kinds of sessions. Or she's part of the group and they're saying, I don't have enough sessions. Breakthrough sessions. I I don't really know the context.

Me: Let's see. Yeah. Like we ought to find out find that out first before we sort of get you head over tails into something is more complicated than it needs to be and then turns out to be nothing or whatever.

Them: Yeah. I don't think it'll be I don't I don't think it'll be a big deal. It's just there's he wants

Me: Right.

Them: to do something there. I mean, I have a I don't have a strong you know, view about what I I think

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, she's thinking about, like, the project that she has. She's you you know, we're analyzing medical data using machine learning, you know, How do we bring in machine learning as part of doing scientific work.

Me: Right.

Them: And they or and or data science. Or, you know, AI is machine learning. Variety. So yeah. I don't know. I don't know if Jay Jay is thing focuses more on sentiment analysis.

Me: Yeah. Her comment her comment was that she doesn't

Them: Right.

Me: really have science stuff, which is probably true if it's a

Them: Right.

Me: teacher's conference. I think it's hard to I mean, if it's math, you can often thread that needle, but science is harder.

Them: Right. So that's why I think Jay's thing wouldn't quite work.

Me: Yeah. I can

Them: Yeah. So I know about that. I think the main thing I wanted to talk about is trying to figure out what proposals we're trying to get in for what things.

Me: Right. Yes. And I'm trying to to think about that as well while at the same time thinking about Poe's, you know, sort of first and foremost. Because it's up on the agenda,

Them: Yeah. That that's the most immediate thing.

Me: right.

Them: Right? Those we only have a few weeks

Me: Yeah.

Them: till we get that

Me: Yeah. And I did and on that, did you know, I was at the meeting on Monday and did get looped in with the sort of current status of of most everything I haven't looked at it since then because I've been getting bored packet stuff together, but I can start to dig into that more tomorrow and early next week as well. Mean I think the and we can talk about it more here too, but mean, I think that takeaway I had is that there's you know, lots of material you know, three proposals, three and a half proposals worth of material probably. What what to do with it is maybe a slightly more open question. Although, it's also not like there aren't a lot of completely unanswered, like, questions out there and, like, we don't know how to target it. We don't know what to say. We don't do like like, pretty much know what we need to do there. But

Them: I mean, this is like the Cisco thing. There's

Me: right. Exactly.

Them: our planning and discovery phase, which was phase one. And then post two is the more of the implementation phase.

Me: Yep. Exactly.

Them: So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, I think we can even take the pose too

Me: That's where I'd start.

Them: that we have. Just a section on, like, what we learned in pose one and what we

Me: Mhmm.

Them: where we wanna go forward and why why we wanna do that based on what we learned in pose one.

Me: Yeah. That's that's probably the right starting point. I agree. So

Them: Some

Me: so I can start to to dig into that, and we can do that jointly over the next starting to next week as well. Yeah. So otherwise, you know, think the answer is you know, I'm I'm open and I'm trying to one of my goals this week is to find a time for people to get together and, you know, talk about ideas a little bit too just because I think we'd we'd be at a good place for people to be sharing what they're thinking. IDD is sort of sort of exists now as well. And and it's better than sitting in the middle of a room and trying to bounce things off of four walls to at least talk a little bit. But but I think we should be putting stuff in know, I think we certainly should be getting proposals ready for the programs that exist on the website right now even if we need to pivot them at the last minute, I think it's way better to have them

Them: Yeah.

Me: ready than not. And I think need to figure out how to spell AI seven different ways, you know, in ways that don't compromise ourselves, but are also and are also interesting, ways that surprise us and don't compromise what we really think is important. Mhmm.

Them: Right. It's like, okay. Take our core proposal on embedded, you know, things that have AI identify what you're

Me: Right. It could very well be. Exactly. Well and I think, you know, I think

Them: you know.

Me: to some degree more is more. I mean, I don't think that we should be putting in crappy stuff. I don't think we should kill ourselves to, you know, to submit you know, lots and lots of things in ways that we think are not gonna be valuable. But I also think that I think there are gonna be people who aren't submitting because they're pulling back and, like, ugh, you know, or people who are like, really? Are we gonna put in the effort? Think there are gonna be cases where people who are DEI centric are gonna have a hard time retooling not everybody, but some. And I think there are cases where people don't won't be able to make an AI case. And I'm I'm sure there are lots of folks who aren't sitting on 12 proposals that were well funded and three that they quite finished and submitted and two from work. So feels like we ought to be able to do some version of what you're describing plus some new things without

Them: Yeah.

Me: know, it feeling like the effort of 12 proposals might normally feel. That's just my my optimistic hope at the moment. As soon as we started, realized I was all wrong, but it's

Them: Right. That's the I I I'm I'm stuck between hey, look at all these, you know, opportunities that are still posted and the senate finance committee is not cutting NSF. And I have all you know, I still have lots of good ideas and so let's let's write a million proposals. And then I'm like, oh, write a million proposals.

Me: I know. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: And then have them come out and say, you know, sorry. I don't care that congress kept NSF funding level. We're not spending it.

Me: I mean, I think, you know, think the way that I 'd feel that pain as well You know, I think, like I said, not at the not at the cost of completely compromising any of the million proposals, maybe it's a half million, but you know, if we have those together, then they can be submitted to other places or cut in the third and put into foundations or what have you. And it may take a half million proposals for us to find our four or five that actually are interesting ideas too. I'm a little bit afloat right now trying to understand what a useful idea is in this sort of weird world where on the one hand, it's AI and we don't really know what's what and nobody knows. On the other hand, it's AI. And so our saying like, this software is really hard to build. That'll hold for another year or two, but it's gonna be different a couple years from now. When people are like, oh, yeah. My grad student made that yesterday. And so know, I don't quite know how to how to thread the needle, and I kinda feel like more ideas rather than fewer might help us find some of those interesting things in there. But, again, that's this has made mostly sort of blathering at the moment. I'm not quite sure.

Them: Yeah.

Me: I mean, I think I think we can resize stuff. No question. I think we can make good stuff too.

Them: Gonna update my know, I have that sort of master document of ideas and mapping to what programs there are. I'll try and update

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that and figure out what I mean, I still wanna do a sort of self adapting help me assess my students like, give feedback to my students.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Because everyone has their way they wanna give feedback. And, like, the generic AI feedback thing well, useful.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: May not give the kind of feedback that you wanna give. And if you're a self adapting you know, AI feedback system, plus

Me: Yeah.

Them: full data tools for for you know, understanding where you're

Me: Yeah, I agree.

Them: sort of

Me: And I think the question is, with all these is like, okay, and where's our spin in it? So if there's anything artificial, so to speak, it might be Happened? So how do we make that do we add the special sauce as well?

Them: Okay.

Me: I don't know what I mean.

Them: Well, I don't see anybody, Joe. I mean, I think people are I think people are just doing they're they're adding automated scoring. They're adding you know, they're doing the generic thing. They're trying to You know, with helping people with codep or helping people with system modeling,

Me: Yeah.

Them: The system modeling group that's, you know, based basically

Me: Yeah.

Them: there flying ahead. There's, you know, the the stellar per

Me: Yeah. I know. I'm I'm I'm I'm reading, like,

Them: basically, 100% of his time working

Me: yeah, Mhmm.

Them: nothing. He still haven't developed what we would want, but he's now hearing, okay. I want a mentor. Not a not not a build not a not a system model builder. Right? Because most people, like, this is a great tool for people who already know how to do, like, system dynamics modeling really

Me: Alright.

Them: well. But for people who don't understand what the model that just got built for them even does, It does

Me: I mean,

Them: it doesn't really work. So but they're building out some of that stuff, and it's also built into this

Me: right.

Them: commercial platform. So

Me: So we should be clear that, yes, I totally agree. And also, aside from the beams thing, which I think is independently funded, I don't know that anybody else is hearing that besides group that sort of tuned in. So I don't The fact that they are still an IC may very well mean that NSF is the last thing on their mind and they're just jogging ahead with something, So maybe we I haven't thought of this until then. Maybe we call him. And say, hey. Like, this could actually be really interesting. And, you know, what if we join together on the education side of this and think about this in general? I mean, he's not

Them: It's oh,

Me: staking out ground saying nobody else could use it.

Them: wow. It's So we'd have to

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

Them: basically build a translator between the SageModeler structure and

Me: Yeah. No. I already did. I mean, I already I already you know, it the SD JSON, which doesn't really exist. But stuff that I was experimenting with recently, which I still have to show you you, you know, pulled in SD JSON and imports it. You know? So it's I mean and besides having it more available would be useful. Now he might be annoying and say, oh, I don't know, or it might be problematic because of other seven other reasons. But, you know, I don't think there's anybody else who's gonna be writing an SF proposal for that. Now maybe we've written 8,000,000 SF proposals in that direction, and we're tired of it. But

Them: of course, the other thing that you know, I'm interested in exploring is you know, in browser AI. Like, what can we do with a small enough, but well tuned model, like, for maybe where I'm you know,

Me: Locally?

Them: local

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and we're not having the I mean, that that's just kinda over the by the time we write a proposal,

Me: Yeah. Right. Exactly. But yes.

Them: like, gets funded,

Me: That that's a good

Them: Like, those things

Me: that's a good point. Mhmm.

Them: right? So we could, like,

Me: Well, they were they were trying to say that, you know, I don't think anybody is, you know, seen it happen. Although they may have gotten distracted by GPT\-five. But they were trying to say on your phone when they released the OSS for a check GPT. Other people are thinking about that too. Yeah, OpenAI did release an open source one a week and a half ago or so. Which was essentially two versions of three, one of which was supposed to be small.

Them: Yep.

Me: So I

Them: Yeah. I don't know how small it needs to be to run on

Me: Right.

Them: in in school.

Me: Right.

Them: Devices.

Me: Exactly. I don't know if it's gonna run on a Chromebook.

Them: We can certainly you know, we'll have it run on I I can certainly run things on my MacBook, you

Me: Right.

Them: but, you know, I'm already

Me: Yeah.

Them: running billion per you know, multi multibillion parameter things on my MacBook.

Me: Right. I mean, then again, we've been in this in this world before. Right? I mean, nothing's up you from doing a classroom based server or something and having it be easier now than it ever was before. There could be models like that. It actually might be really interesting for people because that might be that might be an interesting spin to, like, take advantage of people's concerns about AI privacy. And say, this is a teacher. Like, yeah. Is it teacher only model or something like that.

Them: Yes. So that's an interesting area. But and I have the two highly competitive proposals, which we should resubmit, but I mean, do we have to add AI to everything? Like, there is anyway, things are gonna get funded that don't have that don't mention

Me: If we spend twelve twelve proposals

Them: That the only president in priority?

Me: happy. Have to be AI for all of them. Right? I mean, data

Them: No. But

Me: science is AI. It's just, you know, it's both words or something. I mean, so there's probably lots of ways to do it, but I know what you mean.

Them: Right. Connect, being able to understand these things to the vector analysis. You need to understand

Me: I

Them: where AI work or

Me: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think I think that you I think that at least a quarter of our proposals don't need to be AI, maybe even a third. You know? I mean, I think if we're I think if we only submit 20% of our proposals that are AI focused, I think it's probably gonna be problematic. But there's space for a number of different things and they'll try to fund good stuff. If we don't have to spend a lot of energy rewriting it, then worth throwing things at the wall for sure.

Them: Alright.

Me: Let's see. The Just in that general vein, so two or three things to marinate on One of the things to marinate on that I think is is sort of in your historical wheelhouse of interest is just I mean, the the statement that the and I was just reading this again in MIT technology review that the interesting stuff happening in AI is not happening in chatbots. And the sort of different versions of that statement I think are worth considering. No problem. Go for it.

Them: One second. Sorry, mate. You're well. Super Sorry. She just threw up

Me: Yeah.

Them: here, which I need to go clean up now. But I just didn't want her to eat it again and then throw it up again.

Me: Of course. Yes. That's the way it would be. You know? So trying to think about AI in cases that are pretty different, whether it's you know, thinking about Gemini's, you know, creation of whole world, you know, three\-dimensional worlds from a text statement that just started to happen. Or imaging of worlds The robotic stuff that's happening is sort of whole world stuff too. A lot of that is kind of our how do you sense what's going on in a lab kind of thing. Or what have you. Object recognition. I mean, there's there's whole new versions of that. Are out there that are waiting to be had. Stuff that is thinking about

Them: And I wanted to do you know, VR overlays and simulations on you know, what if you had the super microscope, maybe that'll

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And in order to do that well, you point at something and you need an AI system to identify what it is.

Me: Yep. All there are there are know, glasses now that are I mean, it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be the Apple goggles. It can be know, Meta Meta Glasses or something else or whatever in ways that might be really meaningful. I'm just ordered the brilliant flow glasses to see those are doing as their next iteration. Things like that might be interesting and AI, physical world The let's see. Two other things that are sort of in that vein of, like, a search here. You said memory That to me, I think, is one of the huge unrecognized things in general. I've been trying to look at that a little bit, thinking about virtual assistants and what people are doing, what have you. That is a whole like, it is a world that could not be more important And is not being explored as far as I can tell. I mean, a little bit some but it's like the key to making AI useful over time. And it's sort of there in the models and not really, and it's kind of hidden and hard. And there are one or two solutions out there that are trying to deal with it, but not much, and they're really rudimentary. Maybe I'm missing it. But people are not doing you know, they're not dealing with the memory layer right now. And if we're thinking about education, there's nothing but memory layer. Right? I mean, it's all about understanding where you were and where you're going in the context and what you need, and you so I think there's there's a whole set of things that try to take add in memory layers in some way, shape or form. And then my last realization and the drive back from DC was just that the interesting applications or the application space seems to be like chatbots are useful because they're sort of open ended and they can meet you where you are And the things that come out are often useful because they're tuned enough to be interesting And so the interesting applications are the ones that are like squishy inputs and squishy outputs And like Chewy Nougat AI center. It's not like so predicted that you're gonna lose yourself because hallucinations are gonna kill it. But it's not so open ended that in education, like, where do you wanna go is not question you can ask a class because, like, we've got content to cover here. So how do we find applications that are open enough to take advantage of AI's value to, you know, let you make some choices and where the outcome can be unpredictable enough that we can deal with AI's producing different kinds of things. But still have like, content meaningful, like like, constraints in the middle that are workable. Don't know what that looks like at all. But it was inspired by the guy from Alexa Plus being interviewed on you heard the Hard Fork interview of the Alexa Plus guy? Where he's like, what do I do? Because I'm used to, like, a system that's like this. And, like, his sort of realization that it was kinda like find the right squishiness in the right places. It feels like education needs that in one way or another. I don't know what that means for things,

Them: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.

Me: Well, I don't really either, but I think what it means is it's not like a whole chatbot universe but it's also don't try like, don't look for cases where you're gonna have to spend all your time turning the temperature down to zero, and saying, Oh crap, it didn't give me exactly what I wanted. Like, look for I would talking with Leslie about this. It's like, oh, try to tune the thing to a person Realize that there are lots of different ecosystems, but they all have four different components. So give some choices within those, and then let that plug in. And know enough about what the ecosystem factors are that they plugged in that, like, oh, okay. If you said hawk, then actually it means something different than if you'd said cougar. But it's still sort of this general genre And when it comes out, provide something that is recognizable to a teacher but doesn't have to be the same every single time. Right? Like, how do you provide enough leeway that you're not fighting the tools? That's mostly what I was grappling with in my drive. Have an answer to it yet, but it feels like that's a space that is waiting to be explored and is not gonna be boring. But how do we turn that model into something that we use our stuff for? I know. Mhmm. So that's my

Them: Okay.

Me: my brain dump to marinade on while you're cleaning up dog vomit or walking walking outside or whatever.

Them: Yeah. I know you're doing that before it really soaks in.

Me: Yes. Exactly. Okay. Well, I'm gonna try to find a day when we can have more than one person in the room or a Zoom room. But keep on chugging and thinking about stuff and we'll and I will connect on Pose if not tomorrow, by Monday probably.

Them: Right.

Me: Alright. Take care.

Them: Thank you.

Me: Bye.
