Me: Alright. We'll give ourselves

Them: Who else, said they were coming?

Me: let's see. Well, it's

Them: Let's see.

Me: not entirely clear. I'll give us one more minute, and then I'll

Them: See. Yeah. And it's frustrating that most people don't It's pretty much.

Me: record and dive in.

Them: In the Braunwyn is traveling.

Me: Yeah. Brau said she wasn't able to come. She told me she did tell me that. Other people are not always

Them: Yeah.

Me: able to say one way or another. And it's the invite is just to the well, no. I do have some kind of response here, but it's hard to tell on my phone. And my phone doesn't expand that. Menu, so may not matter. Let's see. Helen and Chris, I would expect Gone went ahead, said yes, but said she couldn't after all. I know Pollock can't. So alright. So I am going to record that people can join in the fun later. Card to the cloud.

Them: Recording in progress.

Me: And I'll just jump in with some updates and this is informal. We're we're not gonna, you know, force ourselves to an hour. We'll just make sure that

Them: Sounds good.

Me: people get some background and, go from there. Let's see. So let me I'll share a couple things and throw it to suited and walk us through briefly the the thing I sent earlier, and then I'll give people a little bit of an update on some of where we're going, from here with our internal group. So just some high level financial updates on where we are with things. There one thing that we've mentioned in the the thing was sent out is that we've got a new foundation award, which is exciting for us for a number of reasons. Number one, because we just starting to tip into the foundation world more, this is a good entree to it. Number two, because this is a planning grant that's part of a multiyear sequence. So Cisco Foundation likes to take groups on under their wing for a series of, you know, four or five years, with the goal of developing something that is sustainable so that they can stop funding. So this was a this is a planning grant where we said we need to even know some things before we can give you a solid plan for what our sustainability for Kodap is. And they said, sounds great. So this is focused on understanding how we onboard users to CodeApp in general, understanding the kinds of resources and support that people need to really start to use it in the classroom and understanding the accessibility needs and not doing any of those, but it's understanding them enough that we can make a plan to move forward on that. And the third reason it's exciting is because this came from introduction recommendation from Ron. And it was a great sort of opportunity to follow through on that. And they were excited from the the beginning and got more excited as we went on. So it was a big thing to get her on and a good example of how Board recommendations can turn into real money that leads to more.

Them: Yay.

Me: So yay.

Them: Exactly. Yay.

Me: Exactly. So there are two other awards that aren't on this, but Sue can speak to a little bit when I pass to her, that are NSF awards. And those are coming in in general. Overall, we've got a series of proposals that are in questions. I think this is up to date. So reminder is in questions means in general, means we are negotiating with the proposal and just finishing the paperwork for it to come in. It is historically rare, you know, and almost unheard of until recent years. We've heard a couple of cases that a proposal would get to this questions phase with NSF without getting awarded This, of course, is not normal time, so we're not counting any chickens right now. But we are watching them move through the process, and the chickens are moving to the grants and agreements stage. Several of them officially recommended in the dashboard and SF other ones. Moving, you know, toward that. So we are, optimistic that everything continues to move forward in the way that we're used to. While being cautiously optimistic in general because there is another stage of the review process that involves some Doge employees somewhere saying, yes. We think that's okay. And ushering the chickens out the door kind of one at a time and they don't necessarily seem to be hurrying in that, process. So we are hopeful that that continues with all deliberate speed and that September 30 you know, fund fiscal year clock doesn't tick its way over before people get things not recommended. But we're we're assuming that that is good and moving forward. And those are some of the assumptions that Sue was mentioning in the the thing that she sent out. So I'll stop sharing and click to Sue just to describe. Yeah.

Them: Let me just ask, and I'm sorry to

Me: No. Go.

Them: get a chance to read what was sent, but

Me: That's perfectly fine. Mhmm.

Them: is there anyone you would hire back if any of these grants came through?

Me: Right. So probably not quite. I'll throw it to Sue to walk through some of what she'd you know, has

Them: Yeah. Actually, Chad, you weren't

Me: been digging through in the numbers. Oh oh, I wasn't sharing.

Them: sharing. So I'm not gonna I'm not gonna share. I'm just gonna talk

Me: Ah, okay. Great. That's perfectly fine. Yep.

Them: Yeah. Unless unless people need me to share. But the was a financial memo sent out before So as Chad said, we have, been awarded two NSF grants, a prime grant and a sub grant just in the last month, and then the Cisco award. So that gives us $1,100,000 new coming in, which is great. I think we have like, five proposals in questions.

Me: Six six that I am showing now, so you can see the

Them: Oh, excellent. Thank you.

Me: breakdown. Yep.

Them: Six proposals and questions. They have been many of them have been well whittled down by the in negotiations, but we are hoping that they do that they are awarded. We should find out by September at the latest September 30 if they're awarded. We're still very cautious, So we haven't say if all of this is awarded now, it still wouldn't mean that we would hire back the people that are scheduled to be laid off on the August 31\. What it would mean is that if you might remember, we were laying off about seven people on August 31, and then asking everyone else who was remaining on to take a time reduction of at least 20% Some people have offered to take more. So, the first thing we would do with the new funds is try to maintain people at their desired rate and not lower anyone's time here. And then if there's any like, money left over, we would extend the runway into FY '27 or FY '28\. So, unless something changes that's not on this list that's enormous I don't see a way that we would be hiring back any of the folks that we are scheduled to lay off on August 31\.

Me: Alright. And we've conveyed that to the staff that are scheduled to be to remain after September 1, and we we are currently, you know, considering or sort of making the assumption that rather than make that reduction, September 1 as we had been planning to simply because of the sort of same timing convenience. That it makes more sense for us to make those changes on October 1 because it's the beginning of the fiscal year. But more importantly, we will know more securely at that point what funding is that we have from these grants so that we don't have to know, make a change and then make it right back, and we could make some change that's, you know, sticks for a while. And, hopefully, that may hopefully make no change and and be solid where we are. Mhmm.

Them: Right. Without without getting into, sorry. I'm off camera, but

Me: No.

Them: without getting into personnel have these folks who either would have retired or would have you would have wanted to move have move on anyway? Or

Me: I mean, none think none of the folks are yeah. None none of the folks are folks

Them: there's there's folks Yeah.

Me: that were saying, you know, oh, okay. Well, we were looking for, you know, chances are they were, you know, probably employed more than they needed to be. You know, I think it's been it's been calculated, you know, carefully to try to maintain the right balance of, you know, the skills and experience in the software development staff where we have some folks who are junior developers and some folks who are, you know, more senior developers. Know, in other cases, we've looked at sort of project management experience and kind of people who have more background and experience across the board versus specific curriculum, development experience and things like that and try to, as much as we can, to make that we are assembling the team that can be versatile going forward. Knowing that we're gonna have to wear more hats than we're used to and take on some slightly different perspectives. I think we've ended up in the end with, you know, more folks with a little bit more seniority than not but in part because we know that they know the ropes some degree and in part just because that's the way it's it's worked out as well.

Them: To add to that, we had come to the Board in late May, I believe, with a pretty drastic plan to cut positions and reduce FTE And when we really sat down and talked with the PIs, soft talked with the chief technology officer, really understood what we would be losing in the we decided to be a little take a little bit more risk and not, cut staff as deeply as we had originally proposed. So in June, we came back and said, look. We didn't cut as many staff. This is a bigger risk that we're taking, but we think it's worthwhile because we'll be able to retain the staff that we need when work comes in. And Right. I think that was the right well,

Me: Yeah.

Them: made the call. So I can say I think it was the right call. I think it was the right call. I think we think it's the right call too. Okay. Good. Well, this is helpful because I

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: I might have missed some

Me: Mean, I think you you take a risk either way. Right? If you, you know, you cut a lot of people, then, you you can survive with a skeleton crew for a lot longer, but you can't do a lot with a skeleton crew. Crew. And especially when we're talking about potential business, you know, scenarios where we're trying to build things for other, you know, organizations or what have you, you know, if we cut all of the developers who have the know how or the the or we just don't have any bandwidth. Then, you know, we're, you know, closing off opportunities. So we we try to balance things as much as we could there. Mhmm.

Them: So we keep moving forward. I only prepared an income statement for today, on August 22\. I'll bring the full package income statement, balance sheet, budget, initial budget for f y twenty six, and also projections for f y twenty seven and f y twenty eight. I'm hoping I'm hoping that in the next month, we'll get more award letters in, and I can give you some really solid, a really solid look into next year. But even without the award letters, I think we can make some assumptions that are reasonably safe As we were talking about before, Ron had recommended a consultant, Rick Bates, who's been helping us do our fundraising preparation, which included the donate to us button that people have tried out, which I really appreciate. Have noted some some wins and some challenges with it, which we've been able to follow\-up on. So far, we've generated a thousand dollars from our staff and board close friends, so we appreciate that too. And we have been in the process of hiring a development So we're in the very final interview stage which actually is gonna take place tomorrow, and then we'll have a

Me: Yep. Yeah.

Them: decision made.

Me: I can give some updates on that in a minute. Let me take a

Them: But, yeah,

Me: second first, though, and give people a little bit more of a look ahead as well. So the other thing we're monitoring is the in congress occasionally does do some things. Last, you know, few years. It's been and not just this year, it's been much

Them: Not so sure.

Me: more occasional rather than than not. But when they when they are in session these days, they are thinking about, what money should happen for next what money should look like for next year. So the I think positive, lining on the clouds so far has been that the administration budget and the congressional budget is people may recall are not the same thing, and what matters is the congressional budget. So the fact that the administration said we should cut NSF by 56 or something percent doesn't mean that that's a foregone conclusion. And in fact, it has not been so far. So the senate has had appropriations committees meeting There's appropriations, and there's allocation, and preparation is how much money we could spend. So we're, you know, a couple steps still. But senate said, you know what? Science matters. They said NASA matters. They said these missions matter. They something, and they said NSF science matters too. So as senate appropriations committee said, point 7% cut instead of 56% cut. And, you know, one of the interesting layers there was they also they got to the second stage of saying somewhat more line by line what, meant And they even listed some programs that they don't normally list the informal STEM learning program, they put as a line item in the the appropriations, which hadn't been there before. But interestingly enough, last year, the house said, oh, here's all the funding we're giving for NSF, and none of it. Can be used for advancing informal the informal STEM So there's some interesting back and forth pushback between houses of congress. You can see that some of these are things like historically black colleges, universities, you know, tribal colleges, some of that might normally be in there, but not all of it. So there's a certain degree to which there's some strategy going on. They're saying, we think that these things are so important We're gonna list them. And in the house, they're not quite as far along. But and the house is more political. Right? Saucer that cools the craziness of the house. We just saw from the senate. But the house has said $2,000,000,000 cut. To NSF, which is still half of the administration suggested cut. So, overall, we're in a, you know, in a situation where the administration's trash you know, sort of slashing NSF. It's not what the congress is saying. And these things still need to be worked out. Then the sort of next layer of of inside baseball or in the weeds piece is reminder that we don't have the second layer of this from the house because the house committee said, oh, well, actually, it's a little bit hot here when people are using that Epstein word. So we're just gonna go home two weeks early. So your people in the house are all on a six week summer vacation instead of their normal four week vacation trying to duck from all the upside questions. And so when they come back, is when these two people groups get together and figure out the difference between, you know, $2,000,000,000 cut and zero or almost zero cut which might or might not be halfway between the two. But what matters is that all of these bills for all of the agents are all done by between September 1 and September 30, because if that doesn't happen, then they don't have something to push forward. And when that happens, then either the government shuts down or they vote on a continuing resolution to keep the budget the same, so you may remember I mentioned the house said no informal STEM learning last year. Well, they said that last year. But they didn't actually ever get to a budget So we're still working on the fiscal twenty four budget because they had a continuing resolution last year because they couldn't agree. If that happens again, and not a betting person, but I would almost bet a coin flip at this point thirty days is almost no time, you know, for these people to work. Then there's at least a non zero possibility that we're working on the fiscal twenty four budget again. In which case there would be no no cut to any of this, and we'd be all the same. So, long story short, it doesn't look like the you know, cut NSF more than half is gonna be the situation. We don't know whether it's, you know, cut still a decent amount or, you know, who knows, even even less than that. But the the sort of really dire predictions of 7% acceptance rate of proposals as opposed to the normal 21 or 22%, I think, are not gonna be as dire as they were. What that means for programs at NSF, what that means for the shape of NSF, I think, is still fully unknown. Where NSF is going to live is still fully unknown. The other inside baseball pieces that NSF spent ten, twelve, fourteen years building this new beautiful building in Alexandria, finally moving in, dealing with issues with the building even then. Very nice once they finally got those issues worked out. And then twenty four hours notice about two months ago, maybe maybe only a month ago, it feels like years now,

Them: Mhmm. Yeah.

Me: Housing and Urban Development said, oh, yeah. We'll take that building. And NSF had twenty four hours notice to realize that they are gonna have to find some new space unannounced as to what that space is in Virginia or wherever. And we'll be pulled out of that building. To make space potentially for the housing and urban development person's, you know, five car parking spaces, etcetera. So lots of turmoil still at NSF. Lots of things going crazy. But the the most dire predictions don't seem to be coming to to bear. Still, the senate version, which is the most you concrete now, would still be 14% cut for education. So belt tightening for sure. But, anyway, that was more about the inner workings of the of congress than you might want to know. But it's important because we you know, it's still very meaningful for us. So internally, we are trying to understand how to write proposals, to an NSF that doesn't know itself what it's doing, deadlines that are on the website, but may or may not be real. You know, staff are saying to me, should I be writing proposals? Should I not? I'm saying, well, definitely, you know, we need to be putting stuff in. And the program officer's advice was NSF proposal of 15 pages. Write the first 10 pages of your proposal and wait till the programs come out, and then write the last five pages. And we're so we're working on getting our ideas together, getting our ducks in a row, thinking about proposals, and then ready to jump as soon as we know what the programs are. Last piece of news on this. Is today. The senate held the Institute of Education Sciences, IES, budget, which is the Department of Ed Ed Research, steady. At 793,000,000 instead of cutting it by 67%, which was the administration's budget. So the senate seems to be as much as they can, holding the line on let's be normal terms of education research and, and science. We'll see what that works out to be. But okay. Last thing I'll give here, and then we can talk about some new stuff or open questions. Sue mentioned hiring. That is unfolding in real time as well for us in lots of good ways. So we in the process of director of development hire. We got 60 or more initial applicants for the position. We've held 13 phone screens in the last couple weeks. We had five we set up five interviews for semifinalists. We had ended up with four interviews that worked out. And we've honed that down to two finalists who are both in person. From Massachusetts, even though this was a wide open position. And we're interviewing both of those tomorrow, in person. Sue and I are gonna be there in person to interview. Ron is gonna be joining remotely. And Rick Bates, the consultant that Ron helped us find, has been marvelous in this process, guiding through helping vet the candidates and hone resumes for us to see He'll be on that as well. We're aiming, you in the best of all worlds for an offer or decision tomorrow You know, worst case, maybe early in the week next week because we need to check references. But we think we're on track to have a role in place by September 1\. Where that goal is both ASAP and in time for the sort of fall push for, both donors and foundation budgets and the like, which usually start to happen September, October, and November so that we can take advantage of that. The just as a reminder or an update, this role is one where we're requiring ten plus years of experience in the field. We're saying it focuses on foundation, corporate, and individual donor giving. We don't expect that this is overlapping with the NSF management work. We think this is separate from that, although we are asking people if they have any experience with that just so that they understand what it's like to work within that kind of an organization is good. And we are expecting that when we write NSF proposals, those are good ideas. In them, there are proposals that we could take and move to foundations or individual donors or what have you at the same time. So we are hoping that those folks have the folks that we're interviewing have that experience. Okay. That was a lot all at once, so I'm gonna shut up and let people ask questions. Or not, which is fine.

Them: I don't really have any questions yet. I have you also have sorry. Proposal that you're looking at. Getting into the pipeline, maybe from these

Me: Jess,

Them: I mean,

Me: No.

Them: so it's not starting from person's not starting

Me: The person's not starting from scratch, and the

Them: Yeah.

Me: the infrastructure is also not from scratch. We mention Rick's been really good from hitting the ground running on saying, okay. You know, I see your house here, but, you know, you guys gotta buy some furnishings. Let's get a CRM going so that you know how to manage these donors and, you know, foundations that are coming in in some kind of a reasonable system. Let's get your website up to snuff so that when foundations and others look at it, they see an organization that is ready to receive donations and has financials posted, etcetera, and let's start to identify a shortlist of foundations and other places that we could target. So we are hoping to hand on, you know, maybe not a silver platter, but at least a well set table, our plans for somebody coming in so they can hit the ground running, And Rick's been marvelous with that.

Them: Think deep.

Me: What's that? Yeah.

Them: I think David wanted to assist.

Me: David, did you have a question or or comment?

Them: No. No. I I I I mean, I'm just

Me: That's fine. Not a problem.

Them: I think I missed the last four meetings, so I've been a little bit out of the loop. But but it

Me: Yeah. No. We're

Them: it sounds like you're in a really role, Chad. I'm really excited.

Me: we're pushing as hard as we can to sort of move this all forward as much

Them: K.

Me: as we can. And I think it's been successful. And I guess the thing that I would say in the middle of it all is that, you know, as we've been doing all of this, we've been working with a kind of core group of folks, on strategy and planning, which has been you some of the directors, and myself and, Leslie are and Cynthia, director of communications, and, you know, some of the PIs that are we know are you know, sort of to the work still, you know, around after September. We had some folks retiring. This is a core of folks who haven't who've been sort of still very into into vital work. And that group has been involved in all of these layers and more. And, you know, I think that's important both because it's been, you a chance to have more voices the table and people involved in the interviewing, for example, for this role,

Them: Move.

Me: and because the more that they are involved with thinking through this kind of new funding world for us, the more they're starting to move into that mindset the more they can help sort of propagate that idea through the organization. The more that when they think about this proposal for NSF, can also be thinking about how we might pitch that for a foundation or how a corporation might sponsor some layer of that idea as So it's acculturation as much as it is sort of assistance and strategy work for folks.

Them: Yeah. I think that's really important, Chad, because you know, it's remember the days when it was we're PIs of NSF grants, and that's what we do.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And and that's all we do, and that's the only way we know how to think. And so having them involved in the process of changing where they actually contribute to it and own it and deeply build the capacity within themselves to figure out how to work a little differently.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: For the good of the organization, I think that's wonderful. And yeah, I I think I think you guys have done an awful lot of work in a very short period of time. And the mind shift is the hardest part. And it seems to me like that's the part that you've really kinda made move forward. So I think that's pretty awesome. Yeah. I agree.

Me: I think it's been useful for folks. And we've been talking about, you know, other layers of strategy in term you know, business development and sustainability and things in that room as well. And I think that's you know, helped move people's minds forward to some degree, and it's also been a useful, you know, gut check for me and maybe some others who who you know, are frequently thinking about these kinds of things as we talk to, you know, industry folks and try to pitch some business ideas to them or we're thinking about sustainability in a different mode. You know, realizing, oh, wait. PIs aren't in that mode all the time. So we need to bring people up to speed a little bit more and calibrate our thinking, etcetera. You know, all of that has been think it's been good on both sides.

Them: Sounds good.

Me: The last thing in that vein that I'll just mention, and we'll put we'll get to talk about this more as things go along. But it's just this word that I've been trying to enculturate people to and sort of move us into, which, you know, some folks, David, maybe are more used to than others. But this idea of user discovery is a short version for understanding the people who use our work, and the people who, know, understanding the problems, the questions, the sort of issues that users have overall. So in the world of product development, when people are creating things that they might sell to others, This is the first thing that you do is try to understand your customers, know what problem they have, know what their needs are, etcetera. In our world, maybe we do it, maybe we don't. Because our customers are really, you know, his the people on the NSF panel not necessarily I mean, the dirty secret is if we get teachers to use our stuff, that's nice. But we need to get the next grant. What that does is make it possible to make things that may not be having as much impact as they could allows us to create things that might have less opportunity to transition into products or might be harder to make a story around impact for a foundation or what have you. So sort of on all those layers, we're kind of I'm hoping to help people recognize that we might be missing opportunities if we are more detached from our users than we'd like than we might like to be. And that conversely, we could be gaining opportunities if we are rooting our ideas in the actual needs and pain points. Of, you know, teachers and users in the world, and still trying to be in innovative in there. I mean, there's there's an interesting gap there. You don't just say what do you want, and what you want is something slightly different than what you had yesterday. You need to listen to what people are asking for and then give them what they, you know, might not know to ask for. So there's, you know, there's some interesting gaps there. And NSF is r and d. Cutting edge. There are cases where we wanna make things that people want ten years from now. So there's a there's a lot in there. But, but all that is just to say that one of the things over the next, you know, six to nine months that we're going to try to to bring into the water is this notion of how can we better discover what, the needs, pain points, and sort of jobs that our users are trying to do, what what are they? How can we reflect those in various ways? I'm hoping that we can get somebody who is a sort of a coach, or assistant in this much the same way that Rick has helped guide us into you know, having a development director in place with the sort of culture and the the infrastructure. There are folks who are called user discovery coaches that help startups or you know, full on businesses who are trying to develop more of a product mindset about how to do this kind of work. On the one hand, it's just interviewing people the other hand, learning to listen to what they are saying between the lines is an art, and a science in itself. So, and there are lots of of routines and mechanisms for doing this, whether it's, you know, conducting lots and lots of brief interviews with users in a know, systematic way. Whether it's going to where they are. I mean, if you're developing a product, you'll go to the, you know, aisles of Target and watch people shop. In our case, you know, can we go and sit in classrooms and and take notes in different ways than we normally would? Not quite sure exactly what that looks like. But I think it you know, the closer we can get to the ground on that, the more we're going to benefit. So that's something that we're hoping to do in a more concrete way. And I'm hoping that we can I'm sure we can, make the case to the Valhalla Foundation who has said in this time of, you know, sort of craziness and shifting ground, we've got $20,000 sort of waiting for you as a as a grantee. For organizational coaching. So they're thinking that maybe more as administrative coaching, but I think that this qualifies as the need that we have there. So expecting that there's some found money that can help us in this process as well. And I guess last thing I'd say is back to that point of bringing the strategy group along and sort of enculturing them, I think we now have a group that is ready to hear some new ideas and ready to realize, you know, just as we have with Rick's help the development director hire that somebody from the outside can help us move in new directions, in useful ways. We're hasn't always been our culture that consultants are seen as somebody who could be helpful for us sometimes there's been some resistance to that. So I'd I think all of that is moving us forward in useful ways. So that's our last current update, but we're happy to take new comments, questions, what have you, and or

Them: That was that was really, really really helpful and as Paul said that, you know, we really have advanced

Me: It's definitely been people have moved. It's been good.

Them: Pam. Yeah. And My question is for how how how are we doing?

Me: We we lost you at the beginning of that. You said my question is and broke up for a minute. Say it again. We hear you now.

Them: You hear me again? Do you hear me? So what's our cash

Me: Yep.

Them: flow status? Like, how do we have a cliff?

Me: I'll let Sue jump on jump in on that one.

Them: Yeah. Sorry. I was Are we spiling until are we silent until when? I mean, that's something we pay a lot of attention to because

Me: Yep.

Them: know, for obvious reasons. Did you see the document that came in an email?

Me: He didn't he didn't he didn't because he's in the car.

Them: Just for him?

Me: But it's still a good question.

Them: Yeah. I so so you might have been answered in there. No. I don't think so. And, so here's my preliminary answer. We we did get the 1,100,000 that I had mentioned It's, it's going Which one? Yep. Yep. Go ahead, Sue. Okay. It's it's going to help a bit. We'll be helped a lot more if we get these six proposals that are in questions. Funded then we should be I hate using the word comfortable right now, but comfortable enough through FY '26 we'll start looking into FY '27 so the cliff isn't 09/30/2026, which is what we were looking at before. Like, we we have room now, but I can't tell you how much because we don't have the award letters in hand. And that's why I've somewhat delayed putting out, like, official financials at this meeting, but I'm gonna wait until August 22 to roll out a bigger planning. Hopefully, I'll have more solid, information that I can count on Well, that's pretty pretty good if you're you're good through September 26\. That's more than a year from now. Yeah. Wait. Yeah. Just more than a year from now. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: I mean, you know, I have to say that that's not an asterisk on it. Why did I get the impression, like, we were in doomsday scenario, like, any minute?

Me: Well, we we were. We were and we're, you know, and and we're

Them: Well,

Me: still, you know, being careful. But, you know, when when the point at the point when we were sort of in the middle of this the with the full board meeting, it it was a very plausible scenario that there would be no NSF grants for another year and a half or what have you. And if that the case, then we're in a very, you know, complicated situation. As it as it has been, we've been, you know, getting questions and negotiation on multiple grants. In a relatively, you know, pretty solid year in terms of, you know, how those grants have been, you know, coming in that way. Now they're not completely past the stage of being awarded yet. That's still you know, we're still waiting on on all that. But if they are, then know, it's it's a normal ish NSF year to some in some cases, you know, positive. You know, we're well, so that's all, you know, that's all decent. Not not a relaxing decent, but, you know, much better than, let's assume nothing is coming in decent that we were at.

Them: And it does include this When does the NF

Me: Mhmm. Right. Yeah. Right. And the layoffs.

Them: When does the intercept year end so that we must know before

Me: September 30\.

Them: September 30? So we actually might not know till the end of our fiscal year how the next fiscal year looks.

Me: Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Right.

Me: Yeah. And we were just saying before you came on, Helen, that we

Them: Right.

Me: are delaying the changes in FTE the staff that will so the layoffs will happen September 1\. Delaying the changes in in FTE that we've been planning to lower to October 1 just because we will know more than and if we do get these grants in, then we might not need to make them in the first place which would avoid our sort of up and down and lots of book you know, book changes for for a month or so. And because then we'll know what the actual FTE changes might need to be starting October 1\.

Them: Right. That makes sense. And you have enough in hand to be able to do that.

Me: Yeah.

Them: For the next month at least.

Me: Yeah. That that's fine. Mhmm.

Them: Right. Exactly.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: We're still doing a lot of finger crossing. It's not

Me: Alright.

Them: not out of the woods, but we're but it's I think unlike a month ago, I guess, I feel like we can see a path forward. It's not it hasn't been paved for us, but, like, it's there's

Me: Yeah. I mean and to be clear, you know, if we hadn't if

Them: a vision.

Me: we hadn't been laying off the seven staff at the point when we are, we'd be in a much tighter situation. We wouldn't be looking as soon as September 2026\.

Them: Yeah.

Me: And, you know, the positive notes in, you know, in my voice are more they're inflections as much as anything, obviously. But you know, it does have to do with the being able to see a picture at NSF where grants are being awarded, there might actually be funding next year or money and, you know, funding a case where we know that the kinds of work that we're doing is getting funded in various ways And you can even look at the other side of it. There are lots of folks whose work is heavily DI embedded and won't be able to write to NSF next year. There are folks who are trying to use AI as a stretch in the things that they're talking about. There are places where, you know, universities are gonna be very gun shy about trying to rely more on SF funds. So there are many cases where you know, some of the usual competition may not be the same as it was. So even if the funds are lower, it's I can see scenarios that feel more normal ish on the NSF side of things. And we're hiring a new development director We're moving people's mindsets to other kinds of things as well. So all of that brings a portfolio balance that just feels feels like there are some paths.

Them: And the the future the next year's budget for NSF no longer looks quite as grim as it does in the president's budget because

Me: Exactly. Mhmm. Yeah. We

Them: the house and the senate seemed to be a little more favorable.

Me: yep. Yeah. We mentioned some of that I was just telling Ellen with people that the that even IES, you know, sent it today. So IES level funded, in their appropriations today. So there seems to be a decent amount of pushback. And like I was saying to folks, you can roll the dice whether they're even gonna get this appropriations done by September 30 now that the house has been gone. So it would maybe on a 2024 budget still, which would be fine with me. So, yeah, we'll see.

Them: And there was concerns about the indirect cost rate being cut very low to 15% and not negotiating any overhead rates anymore. And now it looks like there's a proposal that may actually wind its way through Congress that would make indirect cost rate negotiations even better for Concord, I think, even more fair. And, and to our advantage. So I think there's a lot of positive news out there. Nothing definitive, but you know, strangely enough.

Me: Exactly.

Them: Can I just Very unsuit and still, but moving in the right direction?

Me: Yeah.

Them: It seemed. Right.

Me: Yeah. Go run.

Them: Yeah. So what do you see as the major topics for the August? Board meeting as we

Me: So I think, you know, I think one of them is just to

Them: wind down.

Me: think about bring people up to speed on how thinking, you know, is shifting with a development director in place. And, you know, hopefully, we'll have a person who might even be able to pop their head in, to part of that meeting, to say hello. If they're not officially starting until September 1\. We'll see. I think, you know, part of it is is sort of thinking about these Well, we'll know a little bit more about Patho, not that much more. House will still be out. About sort of what this means for directions forward in terms of how we're tilting our work and thinking about business development side of things as well. One topic I'm interested in getting board members' thoughts on in all of this is thinking about our licensing and how we've frame the world around that. We're, you know, open source and free. Which is a good thing and important for our brand. We've also had a couple cases recently where publishers have said, that's great. You're open and free. Thanks lot. We're we'll take and run with that. And we say, woah. Woah. Wait. You know, actually, we're not trying to be open free to people who are making millions and millions of dollars on our stuff. Maybe we need to think about how we frame that differently. So, you know, so that's an that's just an interesting brand and public facing related question that, obviously is foundational that we'd love to get some board thinking on as well. Mhmm. So, hopefully, that gives people a little bit of background. We're looking forward to having a little bit more to report on August 22\. And it'll be more of a full picture in some of the finance pieces. And, you know, just more chance for to have everybody in in the room to weigh in on these pieces. That is a call, not a a full meeting, so it'll probably be two or or three hours, you know, seven hours. And just a chance to fill in on all this. The meantime, we are again thankful to Ron who's gonna be in the calls tomorrow with the director of development candidates, and we hope to have positive news to report by sometime next week on that search. And be surging forward. Yes. Thanks. Well, great and

Them: Good work. Good job.

Me: to you as well for for all your perspectives and and help on that development director stuff. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. How are how are things going with the seven who are leaving?

Me: They've been okay. I mean, what can you say? Sucks. And we say that in eight different ways. People know that. They people have understood you know, even to the point where I've had people reach out, you know, days after the announcement and thank. Me for, you know, various elements of it, you know, the way we've handled the, you know, the layoffs and given people some time. We're giving them three months in severance. We try to be as human as we can. We've really tried to network with folks. We've had a couple people you know, leave early either because they just it was their choice to, you know, to pull back and to have the time for themselves or or because they've gotten the job. One person who left today got a job through a contact from our CTO's husband's you know, place of employment. And so you know, if a if there can be positives to all of it, I think we've had them as much as we can. I think we gen we don't really have people who are leaving in disgust or dumping their banker boxes on the the road in front of the the doorway or anything. You know? None of us are thrilled about it. But we're we're trying to be human.

Them: Yeah. Just wanted to apologize for coming in late. I just lost track of the time.

Me: Not not a problem. We we're we're recording this so that, you know, people who wanna

Them: Didn't realize

Me: watch it later or listen to it on their morning jog at two two x speed can do that. So so we'll we'll send it out to everybody.

Them: Helen, your your penalty is you have to go in another year as chair.

Me: Exactly. Yep.

Them: Well, that is another piece of business for the August meeting to to decide on some changes to the bylaws that

Me: Yes. Exactly. We're working through some language that we'll put out

Them: will allow that to happen.

Me: for people to to vote on in August on that. Great. Well, we thank you guys for star being sour and showing up, and, we give you some extra time back in your evening and plan to see you in a few weeks at the August.

Them: It's good.

Me: Take care. Have a great night. Thank you all.

Them: Just gave one. Thanks so much, Chad.

Me: Bye.

Them: Bye now. Thanks.
