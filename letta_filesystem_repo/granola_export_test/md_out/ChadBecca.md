Transcript:

Me: Okay.

Them: Hey, Chad. Oh, sorry to be late. Having a little

Me: No. How are doing? That's fine. Not a problem.

Them: even though it just started.

Me: I know the feeling, and my day has been more than started, so I've got few of those already today, but that's the way it is.

Them: Yeah. I guess I also yeah. I've sometimes I try to avoid traffic, so I was up

Me: I

Them: Just leaving six this morning. So

Me: I can identify with that as well. Yes. That's

Them: Yep. Yeah. Sure. Actually, I was just in Boston super briefly, so I didn't get to say hi.

Me: Nice.

Them: But came out for a meeting

Me: That's good.

Them: Yep. Yeah. Fun. Because I went to school out there, and I was like, oh, it's so

Me: Alright. Where did you go again?

Them: Tufts University.

Me: Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, how cool.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Often do you get back to to the Northeast or to Tufts in Tufts proper? Mhmm.

Them: Very, very, very Yeah. It used to be more when I was I've lived in New York for a while, so then

Me: Mhmm.

Them: took a train up and stuff. But I have some prep there still.

Me: Yeah.

Them: But yeah. Yeah. I'll be definitely I just I thought seen you in little while. So

Me: I'm glad that you that we, you know, got back on track here, and I'm happy to do it

Them: Yep. Yeah.

Me: more. I'm glad I could get you some stuff. Sorry if it was, you know, the morning of, but, hopefully, it was useful. Useful as well. And we're it's we're doing lots of good things these days. So it's interesting to call it at all and then sort of recognize it on one page.

Them: Yeah. Which was great. And and I just appreciate. I know we I call about asking you because I knew we had a report coming really soon.

Me: Another no. It's really useful, actually.

Them: Yeah. So it was helpful. Yeah. And I hope you can reuse

Me: Yeah.

Them: Please feel free to raise a bunch for the

Me: And Definitely.

Them: yeah. So I know. I mean, I'm mostly just, like I think I continue the one thing I didn't hear hear in the updates that I still just I'm thinking about you all with a lot is the NSF environment. So if you all if you have updates there,

Me: Yeah. Yep. So we are I mean,

Them: Yeah.

Me: we we don't have as many updates as I'd like. We are watching waiting We have a lot of proposals that are in the pending stage.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Which is, you know, normally a good sign and just sort of wait till they chug out. This year, the chugging is more like a blip and blop here and there. Although, has seemed to pick up some in the last week of mine or these awards very closely now. Last, you know, set of days, it seems like the rate has picked up, you know, somewhat significantly. So that, you know, makes us hopeful because September 30 the fiscal year deadline. And if they don't get things awarded by then, then

Them: Yep.

Me: just sort of reset reset the clock.

Them: Yep.

Me: You know, we're hopeful that continues apace and that all the things that are there get awarded, which would put us in better stead to sort of look forward next year instead of trying to be in, you know, extreme conservation mode or

Them: Yeah.

Me: some level of more conserving than than not. And then on the other side of NSF, you know, whole field is dealing with, you know, trying to reckon with the change changes that they're that they just put out, which you may or may not be as attuned to, but they just suspended archived stuff, whatever you wanna call it, you know, most of their education programs and put out one call that is for tilted toward AI and emerging technologies and is about a quarter of the funding that

Them: Yeah.

Me: it was normally in all of EDU funding. So they here's the the money. They did that. You know, it's it tracks pretty closely maybe a little bit less, to the administration's skinny budget, but that's certainly not what's end up coming out of

Them: Yeah.

Me: congress or not coming out of congress if they can't agree.

Them: Yeah.

Me: It's a little bit of a disheartening move on NSF side to be aligning a reduced, you education budget early on before any information comes out. They did sort of need to do something because these deadlines were coming up and people will be writing proposals to programs that really wouldn't exist so they, you know, their defense, had to make some moves there.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Potentially, but we'll see. So everybody's trying

Them: Yep.

Me: figure out what that means. We don't really know. There's a webinar in about a week. We're trying to it's a rolling deadline now, and it wasn't a rolling deadline before, so there are different dynamics

Them: Mhmm.

Me: people in it. Research have dealt with. We're all trying to grapple with those things and think about what it means for, you know, positioning things, what topics you might propose, not to

Them: Good.

Me: competing with yourself, you know, in etcetera, etcetera. And they're much smaller than they usually were. I mean,

Them: Yeah.

Me: 300 to seven fifty k is, you know, very different than 1\.5 to $3,000,000 So the scope and the sort of

Them: Mhmm.

Me: notions of what you can do have to change, and nobody really So so, yeah, significant rug pull on all of that. And

Them: Yeah.

Me: we're all still figuring out. I mean, we'll still be submitting things probably trying to scramble to make sure that they don't get submitted, you know, really late in the process.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Hopeful that the new whatever happens in congress adds at least adds to that pool, not revive some programs in some way. But the timing on all of that is still indeterminate as well. So

Them: Yeah.

Me: we know a little bit more, we know a little bit less, it's a little bit the same.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mean, we're hopefully, if again, if these things that are pending for us right now all come through the way in a, quote, unquote, normally year they would, we would have more breathing room to be considering what this means and still be nail biting some about the fact that our budget, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: for next year is constrained because the money overall is constrained. But

Them: Yeah.

Me: less nail biting slight on a less, you know, urgent time scale. So next month will tell us a lot, I think, and and hopefully, it tells us good things.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. That totally makes sense. And I think I know you talked about and so you've done a couple kind of preemptive staffing rid of or I know if it's even

Me: Yep.

Them: because you lost some funding, but just some, like, staffing reductions to try to, like,

Me: Yeah. So those those kick in, you know, officially at the end of this week, and then so we'll be smaller as of, you know, next Tuesday or so. We had some people leave earlier

Them: Yeah.

Me: We gave you a lot of notice so that they, you know, have had some time to think about it.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So that will change things. So, yeah, Sarah won't be your contact anymore. I'll be your contact

Them: Yeah. She yeah.

Me: for now, and it is where it is, unfortunately.

Them: Yeah.

Me: You know, we're not the only organization. Everybody has had to do this. It's

Them: Yeah.

Me: so we're

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, hopeful we can mean, that gives us at least more different sets of scenarios and a longer runway even with

Them: Mhmm.

Me: constrained or, you know, even some level of runway with zero federal funding

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Hopefully, have funding, it gives us a little

Them: Yeah.

Me: more foresight for for that going forward.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So yep, exactly.

Them: Yeah. And can you just did you, like, increase by a certain percentage, or how did you

Me: Yeah. So

Them: do that?

Me: seven we we let seven people go. Out of was it

Them: Mhmm.

Me: 35 or so?

Them: Yeah.

Me: Yeah. So, I mean, it was not quite 20%, 15% or so.

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: But in a small organization, that's, you know, obviously meaningful. So

Them: Yeah.

Me: we had a couple people retire just about the same time who were planned retirements.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So it's really more like, you know, nine folks on on 40 or on 35\. So it's definitely a smaller group. I mean, we're trying to take advantage of it to

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: circle the wagons and sort of think more, strategically and organizationally. One of the the kind of complications of the funding model that we have is that everybody's sort of inherently in their own corners because PIs get their own money and they sort of do their own

Them: Yeah.

Me: thing, and it's really easy not to know what the person right next to you is doing. And as a, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: CEO in the organization, I end up kind of checking in on how projects are going, and I can't really do organizational things because the money is

Them: Yeah.

Me: to different people, offer different

Them: Yeah.

Me: really constrained things. So we're trying to open that

Them: Mhmm.

Me: model up a little bit for people even within NSF funding if we are, you know, getting the things that we're hoping we will to think differently about the early years of those and to think more communally about that work.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: But especially as we've got different kinds of funding from, you know, other funders, to start to ask the question, okay. What as an organization can we do that might help us think

Them: Yeah.

Me: So that's where some of this new thinking, and I even think some you know, coaching, which, you know, I think we should be talk about. You know, I think those kinds of things could help us get into the mindset that just not used to because, you know, we we've been entrained on this, you know, in the self

Them: Yeah.

Me: for so many years.

Them: Yeah. And let's definitely because that's not you know, we have this coaching offering that is

Me: Yeah.

Them: it's very it's very easy for me to get it approved now through the end of the calendar year.

Me: Okay. Great. Yeah. Then that that was part of my question.

Them: We we may read out it.

Me: That's great. Yeah. Yeah. So so the I think it's pretty clear now what we need. I've been sort of waiting not wanting to to call it in till I understood the need. I may have mentioned it already, but

Them: Mhmm.

Me: know, the the thing that I was saying is that our last Friday, know, the thing that's most interesting if not vexing about the model, is that our our customer is really NSF. You know, essentially NSF puts out a call for something

Them: Yes.

Me: and we answer that call. And we are selling to NSF and really selling to

Them: Yep.

Me: panels on you know, of of academics within NSF.

Them: Yeah.

Me: And if they like the things that we do, then, you know, we get more money and we sell to them. And teachers are there, and we love them, and we're there to serve them. And for the purposes of our business model, they're kind of like a

Them: It's Yeah. No. That yeah.

Me: accessories. I mean, they need to be there to get the work done, but honestly, you know, the dirty secret is if our if teachers don't use our stuff, it doesn't change that in a set business model, really. Right? They don't ask if they ask, is it it's

Them: Yeah. They're, like, stakeholders, but they're not the customer. Yeah.

Me: It's not usually least. Right? And

Them: Yeah.

Me: so so as a result, can get into this mode where things that are interesting and we've got good intuition. So we don't do bad work at all. And teachers who get it, you know, really take it up and love it. And some teachers do. And we do try to, you know, push the the needle for folks. But, you know, we don't have the model that, you know, a normal business would have where know, people don't like your potato chips, then they don't buy them. And you go out of business, so you fix your thing.

Them: Yep.

Me: Chips to get some

Them: Yep.

Me: like. Right? And

Them: Yeah.

Me: know, we don't wanna be completely in that mode. But,

Them: Yeah.

Me: want us to listen to users.

Them: Yep.

Me: And to learn how to do this sort of discovery of

Them: Yep. Yep.

Me: what people want. And it's a and it's been very interesting to have

Them: Yep.

Me: that conversation and to introduce the idea, and to have PI sort of along the spectrum where, you know, some people sort of get it if they've been in the in other worlds. Others are like, well, we know what teachers want. We always work I'm well, know what the teachers we pay to the early adopters that we pay to be involved in our research want. It's what we said we were doing gonna do, and they love it. But you know, let's, you know, open up this loop a little bit, which is not to say that we're you know, serving lowest common denominator. But I think, you know, I think for me, the model is, we're able to bring that in more and we get glimmers of what people actually need, you know, listen to what they want, think about what they need. We've got the unfair advantage of this massive wheel of innovation engine that we can be like, okay. We we can get $3,000,000 to do that thing. That, you know, we could have proposed anyway. But now we know people want in some way, shape, or form. So then worst case scenario, the impact is better. Best case scenario is maybe they want it and they pay for it.

Them: Mhmm. And then you could have a supplementary. Yeah.

Me: And, you know, sometimes we're making really cool books and, you know so

Them: Yeah.

Me: do we do so, anyway, it's been you know, getting that idea across the PIs is you know, slowly sunk in. But even then, they don't get try to actually do it is not as straightforward thing for people who aren't used to that. So but there are user discovery coaches. Like, this is not a new thing. Like, big companies often

Them: Yeah.

Me: end up, it seems, in the same situation where they we make good products. And people are like, well, you know, sort

Them: Right. Yeah. Did you actually talk to users? Yeah.

Me: but not really. And they're like, I I do that research and they and they're like, no. Actually, go stand in the storefront and listen to people. Like, so so that's what I'm facing right now is, like, the need to get somebody who's like, oh, here's how you, like, take and twist your angle a little bit and, you know, learn

Them: Okay.

Me: people and run some trials and do some you know, and can we gain that language? Can we gain the sort of methodologies that we're used to? Can we, you know, dowse people in that pool a little bit? Because I think, you know, even with six or nine months of that, we will learn a lot we'll be able to start to fold it into all the work that we do. But

Them: If

Me: don't know what to do. I read the books. I can run user sprints and things. But, you know, I don't have the intuition to go, actually, no. It's that thing that people are saying that we need to really listen to. And, you know, you need to get this

Them: Yep.

Me: like, talk to this PI kind of thing. So

Them: Yep. Yep.

Me: I've a couple of folks right now. You know, I'm looking a little bit more, but you know, I'm happy to write up a few bullets about what I think that is and why I think it's really vital for what we're doing right now, and then we can run that up the up the flagpole, and that's useful.

Them: Yeah. That would be great. And I think what I would need for that is just few bullets on the goals, and then it's helpful too if you know who you're working with or kinda who you're about working with.

Me: Yep. Right. That's what I'm trying pin down right now. I've got some leads from folks from, you know, some

Them: Yeah.

Me: of the the other projects that we've done, and, you know, I'm gonna follow this up in the next week or two.

Them: Yeah. That's great.

Me: And then know, go from there. You know, it's, you know, it's still open until the end of the year. I mentioned it to our finance person who said, that's great. How about October 1 instead of September 30? I'm like, oh, I'll ask. She's like, okay. Great.

Them: Well and also, and I think a general rule with Fajala too, it's can also always pretty much always there's to be, like, a reasonable reason for it. Like, approve something kind of informally and then

Me: Yeah. That's what I was figuring. Yeah. I can send the

Them: and, like, I can get all approved on my end, and then we can actually, like, send more award letter and payment

Me: on to, you know, get the right

Them: dated whatever time you want. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. Set it all up to go and put it in the mail in October 1\. Yep.

Them: Yeah. But if you're like, we actually want this to hit on this date, that's that's

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: perfectly fine.

Me: So I think I think that'll be really fruitful. We got some folks inside who are really jazzed about it. Already and ready to help and work with somebody. And we've had I think we have made progress in terms of people being recognizing the value of external folks. We you know, as been many examples historically where a consultant a for word for people. I couldn't, you know, get us to take in new

Them: Good.

Me: perspectives to save their life. And, you know, with the person who came in recently

Them: Yeah.

Me: working sort of gear us up for this development director hire, It's very positive, and people really, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: chime, you know, resonated with him, and it's been exactly what we needed. I mean, his goal was not to soak us for all we were worth, in fact, it's really been really cheap. But to, you know, like,

Them: Yeah.

Me: week two, he's like, you need to hire somebody, so let's get on that, and I'll help you with

Them: That's great.

Me: something, but I wanna, like, get you hired and and out of the way and, you let's send Christmas cards, and you can call me anytime you want. But, like, let's go.

Them: Okay.

Me: And that's been really useful. So that mode, I think, people are attuned to that, will be

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: I'm hopeful, really, you know, generative for folks.

Them: Yeah. That's great. I wonder too. I'm thinking about both of these pieces coming together because

Me: Yep.

Them: think remember the way we were I think in your grant agreement too is, like, have and I you've been talking in this guy, but, like, as a developing, like, a, like, a business

Me: Yep.

Them: plan

Me: Exactly.

Them: And so I don't know if you feel like you've got that capacity on the team already to to

Me: I mean,

Them: put put these together, or is that something that, like, the coach or consultant we can come just to make

Me: I'm so I would hope that that I would hope it would

Them: Yeah.

Me: start to fall together. We don't really have I mean, we

Them: Yeah.

Me: we have some capacity for that, but not enough. I think the thing that we don't know I mean, the the really interesting complex thing is that, you know, we're we're in, this, you know, basement full of awesome toys. Some of them are, like, brand new, and we think they're cool, but we don't know if our friends do. Some of them are, like,

Them: Yeah. Mhmm.

Me: 10 years old, but they're oldies but goodies. And you know, you look around, you're like, which one of these

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, would sell at the garage sale? Which one do I post on basic messenger? Which one do I keep, and find something else. And, you know, I can only do that with three or four of them because I only have so much time.

Them: Yes.

Me: And so and we're all myopic about it too, so we think they're all amazing. But alright. Yeah. Alright. So so getting somebody to come in and go, oh, okay. Well,

Them: Yeah.

Me: let's let that teddy bear sit for a while. But

Them: Yeah. Well and that's

Me: about this truck?

Them: I wonder if it could be the same person because I feel like somebody coming in to say, like, here's all the options. Let's

Me: Right. Yep.

Them: actually, like how do we, like, put it it doesn't have to be planned where we, like,

Me: It's a

Them: upfront know what we're doing, but, like, here's how we're gonna decide. Is we're gonna these user interviews, we're gonna

Me: Yep.

Them: understand what, you know, our value is. We're gonna send this

Me: Yeah. I think yeah. And and I think that notion of, you know,

Them: already done around, like, SWOT analysis and stuff.

Me: of user discovery, prioritization, ARC, you know, is really what we need to sort of because we also need

Them: Yeah.

Me: to know where the line is, which we're feeling out a little bit ourselves, but we're not gonna put phones in the backroom and start being sales you know, or a sales organization. And really don't quite know how to productize either. We make research stuff. So we need to understand sort of whom we might work with and where they handoffs are and when to call it and when not. And so it's some somebody who's sort of jack of many trades along that arc, I think, is useful. One the the the one name that I've gotten that seems most fruitful, I've to reach out to. She's up in Maine. So if she responds, that might be one good one. But I'd be very open to other, you know, names too. So if you're thinking of

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: conversations or recommendations of anybody who'd be, you know, stellar along that line,

Them: Yeah. Let me think

Me: I'd be love to hear

Them: Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll think this over. I probably will have someone in our network.

Me: Yeah.

Them: That someone least has worked with before. Because I do think I do think you want someone you want someone who speaks y'all's language, but also I think somebody who's, like, not overly like, prop like like, what's don't know the way to say this. Like,

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I think we need somebody who's in the and willing

Them: you want somebody, like, nimble, I think. Yes.

Me: you know, willing to work with us as academics who, you know, need some

Them: Yeah.

Me: some training and knowing that we're, you know, there's there's some diamonds in the rough there, but, you know, you gotta spend some time to find

Them: Yeah. But we also want somebody to kinda, like, go take you through it year long process because you already have a lot

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah. What we we don't have time for it. Yep. So and and that's what's been great

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Me: the, you know, the work we've done with Rick on the development director's front is that he hit the ground running he wasn't he wasn't being unreasonable, but he's like, okay. You know, we're

Them: Yep.

Me: these things and these things both at once. Let's meet with this group and to end just within a couple months, we were digging in and and heading forward. And that's exactly the timeline needed. So

Them: Yeah. Yeah. How would it I just wanna as I if I do outreach about this, I don't know if like, I'm thinking about what I would be asking. It's, like, somebody who can help sort of, like, synthesize

Me: Yeah. I let me see if

Them: Like, you've done a lot of, like, SWOT analysis stuff already.

Me: Yeah. We did some of that already. Let me see if I

Them: Yeah. I guess I can hear you.

Me: find the the paragraph that I sent on other person.

Them: Oh, yeah. That'd be great.

Me: Useful.

Them: And I think it deliver I mean, I do think, like, I do think y'all having a I mean, we don't offer for the grant, but a business plan, I think, would be a good deliverable, which would be the synthesis of all. These things. It's like we did our customer interviews. We sort of mapped out some different choice plan here, but we're gonna try.

Me: I think it could very well be. With the caveat that know, it so it might be that, you know, leading too heavily with that distract somebody in that

Them: Yeah.

Me: it's, you know probably the answer is it's actually three separate business plans three different models, and we're gonna have to choose which one we actually want, have time and energy to

Them: Yeah.

Me: do. And

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: so it's sort of productization slash business

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: model at the same time. The the grand business plan is something that

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: we're trying to find a corner of it you know, to to work with the other ones that we already have.

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: Alright. So I'm gonna send you oops. That's not

Them: Yeah. That makes

Me: Oops. No rec. Okay. There we go. That's easier. Edit a little bit, I'll take his name. Person. Okay. We go. That should give you something to get started

Them: Yeah. That's super helpful. Just to

Me: go. Yep. Yep. Yeah. So, you know, I think the other as I've been referring to,

Them: Great.

Me: news is just that, you know, we're thrilled to have the development director starting Monday, which is the first for us. And, you know, thanks to Mahalo, and I think it's gonna be huge to paradigm shifting for us to think about, you know, where we've already been gearing up with this, you know, consultant to sort of understand what expectations and deliverables and things might be, you know, or he's helped us recognize that, you know, it's not just about you know, foundations, but, you know, we are

Them: Yep.

Me: corporate people who like to sponsor things. And we have things that could be sponsored. So and he's like, you know, every one of those really awesome products is, like, have somebody's name on it, and it could be 100 k a year or whatever. So we're sort looking at that.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: you know, start to slowly turn the crank on, you know, recognizing that users can give us money even though that's not gonna rain money tomorrow, but, you know, it's silly enough to do it. It could uncover leads. And, you know, obviously, you're thinking a lot about private, you know, funders and foundations of different types of stripes. And you know, high net worth if it comes out in the wash amid that all not gonna go chasing, you know, instantly. But as you said, you know, sometimes they're surprising. Right? And sometimes it's really

Them: Yeah.

Me: So we're we're gonna look for that at the same time.

Them: Mhmm.

If not, we're still gonna be moving along those lines try to engage people and users and contributors in ways that are more more complete than we do right now. And we're sort of open source in name only and lots of ways right now. Mhmm. Definitely.

So it's possible I may have some everything from your grant report. It's possible I may have some miscellaneous updates for
