Transcript:

Them: Oops.

Me: There you are.

Them: So how are things?

Me: Are you doing okay? Moving along. Starting to move into different modes with people that's emerged changes to school year and proposal season comes up and the like. Or, you getting PIs to activate that way. Sent out things to the board, got our director of development some picture, photo session scheduled, so she will have a picture of her on our website when she starts. Exactly.

Them: No word on Negrands, I suppose.

Me: Not yet. No. I haven't checked in the last couple days to see if the the slowdown that happened for a few days there has picked back up. I did hear somebody, Danny at BSCS, just posted in the back channels yesterday that they had gotten core award, which I think meant that relatively recently they got that award awarded. So mean, there is momentum still happening. Just

Them: Good.

Me: how we want the rate to continue and increase. Let's just say it that way. So Mhmm.

Them: Yes.

Me: Yeah.

Them: That would be very nice if some of that will come in before Friday.

Me: Agree. I'm not not holding my breath, but I will take it if it comes. That's for sure.

Them: But Yeah. And anything else

Me: Sure. Mhmm.

Them: that I need to know that's going on?

Me: I don't think so. So, I mean, we're we're with our internal group, we're revving people up to, you know, both on proposals coming up in the season, but also on sort of learning from users. We we just went to a conference in and had a focus group there, and we're planning two or three others in the next couple of months. To learn from teachers and having productive conversations about what people are learning. So I think it is shifting people's heads to

Them: Actually, joke.

Me: think more about actual problems

Them: To cheat. The ones they're working with.

Me: exactly, problems of people in the world, and learning some interesting things. And one of the things that we got from this last session was, you know, everybody is using Open SIAD. And granted, we're in New England, so maybe that's a tilt. But, you know, they're using it because they're required to They don't what was Dan saying? He's saying, if I if I gave you the choice, love it or hate it, then nine out of 10 would say hate it. If I ask more about it, it becomes nuance. But, you know, it's it's a lot of curriculum a long time with one phenomenon, Some of the teachers, interestingly, were saying it felt like they were they ended up as sage on the stage, which is we know is certainly not the

Them: Right.

Me: intent of the people developing the curriculum, but sort of functionally, it's turned out that way.

Them: Probably

Me: So you know, we had a good conversation about that. Mhmm.

Them: could lack of PD about how to do it otherwise.

Me: It's possible. Although, certainly, there is no lack of PD in open around open side in general. I don't know what PD these teachers have had. But but it was interesting. You know, the like, one teacher who had was presenting later on that day about a rewrite she'd done of the module to make it more place based because she said, I don't live in Colorado. So my kids can identify with it something. So as we're doing that, we're asking sort of, you know, underlying questions about are there opportunities there for know, us to provide sort of additional layers onto a module for them, you know, to rewrite a module so it's, you know, got more techno simulations and choices. In it to, you know, pair with somebody and, think about ways that we could repurpose some So, you know, I I think it's gotten people into into a space of saying, oh, okay. I hear teachers sort of like something would not enough. And, you know, what does that mean for what we might do? And when I have conversations with PIs, you know, are different layers of that. You know? Yes. You could make a product, or you could make a proposal to NSF that is grounded in something that you heard from teachers. And, you know, when comes out the other end, you've got a much better chance that it's gonna have impact or product along the way or what have you. So

Them: Alright. Right. Since it is a curriculum, a lot of people are using building some proposals around it.

Me: Right.

Them: Really be important.

Me: Sure. It makes a lot more sense to think about the problems people have right now than the ones that they don't if they're if they're on this train. Right?

Them: Right. Right.

Me: Make a better make a better dining car because, you know, you've got people on the train. Mhmm.

Them: It's I would say, a very large fraction of schools are using it because it's available.

Me: Right.

Them: And

Me: Exactly.

Them: it's cheap,

Me: Mhmm. Exactly. It's available. It's cheap. And and it's well grounded. I mean, it's

Them: Whether it is or not, in the end, another story. But

Me: Right. Yeah. That's yeah. Free free puppy. Yes. But but it definitely is You know, it's there. It's and and it's well reasoned and and thought through.

Them: It's not bad. It's

Me: No. Definitely not.

Them: it's

Me: Know, we were all saying that. We we get it entirely. I mean, when

Them: done It

Me: that's the kind of thing that we wanna do is get you six weeks deep into a curriculum or whatever and teachers are I mean, it's a oh, again, was the one only one focus group. But, you know, they they weren't saying that the notions were wrong. It was that that in the actual execution, you end up spending four weeks on bath bomb and kids get tired of that. Or you end up feeling like you have to lecture in some way. So it was

Them: Yeah.

Me: mean, it's sort of the two point o problem. Let's revise it. But

Them: Well, right. And and or let's think about what it is that

Me: Exactly. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: need to be able to use it the way it was intent. Right? What is the barrier that's stopping them from from making it into really student oriented learning?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Student boat

Me: Yeah.

Them: and student

Me: The interesting word that came up when were debriefing that session was that at least more than one teacher talked about wanting to revise it or make changes themselves. But do it in a way that was safe. Like, the uncertainty of how to not corrupt the I mean, it sounded like teachers were aware of the concerns about sort of fidelity and corrupting the curriculum by revising it.

Them: Dog barking at the toilet.

Me: That's fine. And so that

Them: He wants to come in.

Me: that there might be something in there too of that idea that we can provide you know, some version or some variations or some augmentation that is, you know, pedagogically aligned and and safe, you know, so that you don't have to worry that you're, you know, deviating this thing that your administrator wants you to do, but your kids are more engaged. You know, or something like that. Mhmm.

Them: Right. Right. Well, I need to figure it out. Not only what we could do, but what somebody will pay us to do

Me: Right. Exactly. Yes. I mean, it definitely starts with what they want, but then it

Them: is

Me: goes to beyond that. So

Them: Yeah. Yes.

Me: so, yeah, that's the those are the interesting problems.

Them: But but understanding how teachers think about these things will be so good for our PIs.

Me: Yes. Exactly. So we've got a you know, we've got two more conferences in, the Massachusetts area, three more maybe in the Rhode Island area in the next couple months. We're organizing, if it works out, a focus group can Kentucky. With the the Kentucky Science Teachers Association. So

Them: That's good.

Me: you know, people say, is that different? I mean, well, we don't know. It definitely if people in Kentucky have the same concerns as people in Massachusetts, we're onto something. If they have different ones, then we wanna know about it.

Them: Right. Exactly.

Me: So both both of them are good. Right?

Them: Right.

Me: So

Them: Right. Right. Right. And and it may be they're being asked different things by their

Me: right.

Them: the idea. Is it particularly the state assessment? Is it particularly something so

Me: Mhmm.

Them: looking at at least two states is import I mean, Rhode Island is tiny, so it's hard to

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Mhmm. Right.

Them: use it to compare it into

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. So so I feel I think that that's opening up, you know, thinking and conversation

Them: That way,

Me: and doing it at the right point where we're, you know, gearing up for you know, thinking about proposals as well so that seeds the pot with that and also

Them: Really have to know what kinds of proposals will

Me: and then, you know, we are yeah.

Them: move forward in the next week. So

Me: I know. It's so I mean,

Them: lot of churning in that.

Me: the AI is the only the only that that anybody has is that AI, you know, needs to be somewhere in in the middle of it. And it's

Them: If you look at what

Me: trying to do that originally is hard.

Them: what what teachers are saying is basically

Me: Mhmm.

Them: AI is stopping us from doing things. Right? We're we're using what all of the effort of teachers around AI is oriented to stopping students from misusing ChatBit GPT.

Me: Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah.

Them: And and that's really not a productive

Me: No.

Them: use of everybody's time. Right? I mean, it's it's necessary perhaps

Me: Yeah.

Them: but having teachers think positively I mean, I saw this at the Kyle Wyman event where they he had teachers who had been using, you know, working with with

Me: Mhmm.

Them: FIT, for example. And saying, okay. But we have to go to pencil and paper testing

Me: Right.

Them: otherwise, they'll they'll cheat with chatty

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: And so it's really difficult

Me: Mhmm.

Them: figure out how to to get past that barrier

Me: Yeah. We're trying hard to think about that

Them: it's Well,

Me: You know? It's the, you know, it's the orthogonal opportunities that are the

Them: Right. Exactly.

Me: interesting ones about the where AI in the middle of the system can help make changes or where you can find something like the teacher who said my kids don't live in Colorado. Well, that's fine. You know, biology's you know, ecosystems still apply in, you know, Rhode Island.

Them: Right.

Me: So tell me give me give me four creatures your kids care about. Right? I know enough about

Them: Did you a different pick a different ecosystem.

Me: creatures and ecosystems that I can design something that has the same principle in it, but is, you know, designed for you, right, or something like that.

Them: Right. Right. Or just just digging in. A tool that lets teachers do that modification to a different

Me: Right.

Them: ecosystem in the

Me: Mhmm. Or maybe even the students.

Them: in fashion for the teachers' time.

Me: I mean, I think the the problem is of differentiation is that you, you know, get kids in such a different place that you can't, you know, tell the difference between student one and student two. Work. But if it's, again, pedagogically safe, if you know that the things that that I'm giving the student are going to end up in the same place as I'm giving the student then maybe they can choose their animals. You know? That's fine. Right?

Them: I Right.

Me: Yeah. So we're we're definitely interested in that.

Them: They're local, like, the ecosystem in cigarettes,

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: how these principles apply to it. What are the principles we're supposed to be applying here?

Me: Or mhmm. Yeah. So we're trying

Them: Yeah.

Me: trying hard to think about that in a way that can use our and and are there ways that we can use our sort of secret sauce, whether it's the technology or the wherewithal, the know how to differentiate from all the others out there who are proposing AI plus, you know, fill in the blank because

Them: Right. Yep.

Me: certainly certainly that's what's gonna happen and needs to in this climate.

Them: Yes. And and what AI can do well

Me: Right.

Them: for for learning science not just for

Me: Mhmm.

Them: teaching it, but for learning it. I mean, it it as a teaching tool, as a tool for analyzing student data, etcetera,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you can find applications, but what is it that

Me: Right.

Them: you can teach students that makes them think and makes them use AI

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: effectively rather than to avoid thinking.

Me: Yeah, exactly. Yeah,

Them: Very tricky. Oh, you've got

Me: Right.

Them: set of challenges. I think board will have questions about why are you writing proposals to NSF when NSF isn't funding anything.

Me: Think so. Yeah. That's fine. I mean, I'm happy to answer that question. I mean, I think

Them: That's I think there's an answer to it.

Me: I've been answering that to PIs regularly.

Them: Yeah.

Me: I mean, so they're

Them: I think there are good answers, but but you have to decide what's your and

Me: yeah. Yep.

Them: particularly for you, if the PIs have to write proposals and some of them have to be to NSF,

Me: Yep.

Them: But how should you be spending your time

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Exactly.

Them: And how much proposal writing should you be involved in?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: If something the board might have questions about. So you need to be ready to answer

Me: Yep. Yeah.

Them: that, and as to how you plan to split your time between working on that front and working on the other fronts that we've now opened up to be worked on?

Me: Yep. Yeah. No. That's, I think, entirely true and and finding the right balance there. And there, you know, I'll also

Them: I looked at the materials you sent out. I think they'll

Me: it's good.

Them: some good discussions and I'll

Me: Yeah. Hopefully so. I mean, we'll

Them: the financial data is what the financial data is, and

Me: exactly. Yep.

Them: I did it in a nice, clear fashion. So

Me: Yep. That's great. Yep.

Them: Okay.

Me: Yeah. I think that's the goal is to, you know, get people oriented in the common place

Them: It from there.

Me: to, you know, get them acquainted with the questions that we're grappling with even though we know we won't time to dig in. In many cases, you know, there's only so much that people can dig in on some of the questions, but we want

Them: Right.

Me: them to be activated around them enough so that when we start to come out with, you know, our takes or directions on them that they they have some understanding of what the the nuances are. Mhmm.

Them: Clarify for me a little bit what are the issues on licensing?

Me: So the issues on licensing are that right now our stuff is free for everybody. And, that includes publishers and what have you. The the next layer down is so we would like to make money if you're making money. The next layer down is if we were to just say, okay. No more open anything. Then there we cut off our nose to spite our face in lots of ways. Because being free is a valuable proposition for

Them: Right.

Me: lots of a big subset of people, educators, funders, etcetera. Mhmm.

Them: Cut off many users if you if you say all of a sudden you have to pay.

Me: Right. And and if we'd say our philosophy has changed radically, we cut off, we lose, you know, we built up a lot of good will and brand proposition around being free. They're not mutually exclusive, but we need to think about how to frame that for people and do it in a way that communicates to the world of people who are making money that, you know, we're not necessarily free for you. But we're good quality and we're worth paying for.

Them: Right. And so right now, if you said to Thomas or whoever else you're talking to, No. You need to license it. They'd say, why? We we can use it, so why not

Me: Right.

Them: We'll we'll just we'll just tell teachers to use it.

Me: Yeah. Which is what they've done, and it could. And so some of the nuances might be in the rules of the road around what you can do or not. Can you link our stuff within your curriculum, etcetera? You know, that's,

Them: It is something

Me: it gets nuanced.

Them: too. So that's

Me: What's that? Right.

Them: and we want them to.

Me: Right. Exactly. So so figuring out that back and forth piece is and, you know, I think the more concrete one is just is finding a license that doesn't make publishers presume that they can use our stuff for free, that they get the message that we're free for educators, but not for people who are making money. And, you know, it's recognizing ourselves that we've we and the world have grown up to the place where that is a valid proposition now, whereas it wasn't

Them: Right.

Me: fifteen years ago. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: So who who are you talking to about this? I mean, is it a lawyer? Is it

Me: So we have a really good IP, you know, group. That are that work with us on license on language in general. They do think through these kinds of models, so, so they're one of the parties. I don't know, you know, who the best, you know, person to think through the kind of business model and reputational implications of it is. You know, right now, we're we are working with example use cases like the Savvas one to say, okay. What you know, what's gone wrong so far in that, you know, the messages that we're sending to people. And we are testing the waters with them, you know, and others who come in in the last month or two who've sent letters as I was saying, well, it's not gonna stay like this. And they're saying, well, it's fine, but we didn't budget for this last year. And so we're you know, back and forth between and we could write them a letter that says, fine. We're changing the URLs and pulling the plug and you know, you you gotta change your California curriculum tomorrow. That's probably not valuable to do, but we need to stop, you know, selling our stuff for free. For them. In other cases, people come in recently, you know, sort of random Italian publisher and said, this is great. Can we get all the links And we said, well, yeah, but actually we need to license. And they said, oh, That's cool. We need to go talk to our guys. We'll call you in a couple months. And so, you know, we know we're gonna lose business. I mean, we're not losing business, but we're, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: we need to figure out how to design those rules of the road in a way that communicates it right so that when the conversations come in, they come in on the right footing, and we're not having to recalibrate in the middle of the

Them: Right. So the the when they go to the website and they already know that they're going to be have to have to license it, if they're gonna use it in a in a for sale curriculum.

Me: Mhmm. Right. And it doesn't I mean, it extends to the other models we've had too. I mean, all the work that we've done has been under the duress of a free license so that, you know, we've been paid for the upfront work to orient something. Not paid any licensing or royalties beyond that. So, you know, our main model would have to change to something. But that can change in lots of ways. I mean, all we're saying is that we don't have a blanket license for you as a publisher to take and run with it. We're saying we can choose that license, and, basically, we'll work with you on that. So let's talk. I mean, it might be that the effective version is, you're willing to pay enough upfront that we'll do custom version, then we'll give you a free equivalent to ownership license, you know, for for the next five years and renegotiate. We we have every right to do that. That's what copyright is called. It's your right to license it however you want, essentially. Mhmm.

Them: Right. Right. I mean, we we we certainly have the right to do it. The question is,

Me: Exactly. Yeah. What is the right copy right?

Them: what's the right way for us to do It and and I mean, it's very clear that that the world has decided that that ongoing fees is better than than purchase.

Me: Yes. I mean, People now understand that subscription is a way. And so we might be back around to the place differently than where we were when we first tried this business model at work that was on the way out, you know, IP licensing was on the way out. People might be back around to a models where they're getting enough recurring income that it's okay for us to take a cut of that in some way, shape, or form.

Them: Yes.

Me: And, you know, I think that's the model that we wanna start with in most cases. The percent it might be a small percentage, but give us a percentage of your revenue

Them: Alright.

Me: It's people do understand that.

Them: Give us a

Me: Right.

Them: a small amount of money based on user base. The size of your user base.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. And it may be in some cases, we've had these conversations in the past, maybe that we need to take an upfront, you know, cut on that if we're gonna do some development.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Or what have you. They say, well, we're not gonna pay you to develop. We're paying you licensing. Okay. Fine. Well, give us the first year of licensing upfront. As a prepayment so we can do the work or something like that. Mhmm.

Them: One more question triggered

Me: Yeah.

Them: in looking at the KPIs.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: First of all, there's some error in one of them because the the

Me: Oh,

Them: two pieces don't add up. The sum is

Me: that's

Them: the the

Me: possible, though, because of the way it calculate. It calculates from the spreadsheet, and it pulls back the road before. So I'll look at those anyway.

Them: Yeah. So it's it's probably rounding error, but it's still what it says this is the 25 and 15 of them are this and nine of them are that? Or

Me: You're right. The sub plus nine is 23, not 25\. Okay. I will look at that.

Them: Exactly. Minor thing. But the other thing that that it triggered for me was thinking about I've lost the thought. While we were talking The the vet I know. It's the the days

Me: I was saying the

Them: or months covered for development stuff is low.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Yes.

Them: Is there an issue is there a way around that? Is there a hope for fixing that? Where is that

Me: I mean, so that's the that's the difficulty we're in in

Them: the whole

Me: that it was so well, okay. Two things.

Them: I I mean, I know you didn't lay out a off a developer because you wanted to

Me: Right.

Them: the freedom to be able to take on what

Me: Yeah. So I need to look at and check\-in with Sue to see to verify that that month's what the denominator on that month is in terms of people because it may be that that's months of our current development staff, not months of our post September one development staff. I'm not sure. You know? So if that's the case, it could be a big difference

Them: You have to post September 1, you have

Me: So I'll with

Them: to be do using the new number.

Me: right. Exactly.

Them: It looks like we sent it in.

Me: Right. All that is to say that it it that our development numbers are worse than our other numbers. You know,

Them: Right.

Me: we we have we have fewer staff or we have fewer funds for development staff support than we do proportionally for other staff support. And that is both because somewhat because of what you're describing that we made the choice to not lay off quite as many development staff so that we've maintained a a skill set that was balanced across. And also because we are underfunded on development staff right now because of the nature of the way that proposals get written and funded and what have you. We have to write a whole lot more proposals to fund given development staff and it's been easier to write research proposals sometimes than development proposals, so you you can get overfunded on project staff, you know, a little more easily.

Them: But then we see

Me: I know. I know. Exactly. So we're in this problem.

Them: to be doing what what we claim is it.

Me: You know? So figuring out how to balance that is one of our conundrums.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Do we do that by, you know, thinking about private funding differently? Possibly. Is private funding gonna fund software development? I don't know. We think about it by being leaner in the way that we do our software development? Because, you know, we can program more with fewer resources now? That's possible as well. But we don't have a we don't have a great answer for that one. And it's been one of our conundrums

Them: I suggest that by Friday, you have a bit

Me: Mhmm. Yes. Yes. No no question about that. I can change it on the dash

Them: answer for what does that number actually mean. And

Me: live if it needs to be. But but it is our conundrum, and I'll I'll have a a more nuanced answer for how and why it is and how we're aiming to address it even though I don't have a solid, you know, guaranteed answer for the fact that we're going to. We know it's a problem. It's when, you know, Sue alludes to different people coming back to different FTEs You know, our calendar all the way along, our adjusted calendar has had a shorter runway for development staff relative to other project staff. Because the funding pool is not as big for development staff right now. Mhmm.

Them: Right. So figuring out how some and it it actually means that in searching

Me: Mhmm.

Them: foundation money, thinking about how to target some of that search to money that will

Me: Right.

Them: support truly creative development work, is

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. I agree. And I think that well, we'll see if there are if that's a story that that sells with people or if you just need to frame it as know, in the past curriculum development, we've called, you know, curriculum development when it's mostly software because that's how we develop curriculum. I'm not

Them: Yeah. No. I think

Me: sure what the balance is there storytelling wise.

Them: you have to the story needs to be that the there's

Me: Yeah.

Them: where the need is right? People are doing curriculum development,

Me: Right.

Them: with no software in it.

Me: Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: Right. And and we're doing totally

Me: Mhmm.

Them: online and

Me: Right.

Them: creative use of the online capability. But which is leading you know, that's our leading edge piece.

Me: Yes.

Them: And and so how we

Me: Mhmm.

Them: frame our fundraising around that leading edge piece not being lost

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: And not just our fundraising, our proposal writing too.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Is is really important. So think being ready to discuss that with the board, I think, is

Me: I I think that's a good point, Alan. Yeah.

Them: is good. Okay. Those are

Me: Alright.

Them: my points having spent the morning read

Me: That's great. Good questions.

Them: thinking about what you said is

Me: Glad to glad to know.
