Transcript:

Them: Hello.

Me: Hello. Are you? Alright. Alright. Okay. So So that's that. Alright. Oh, hi.

Them: So many things to talk about, so little time. Although I

Me: Exactly.

Them: although I do not have a meeting at 01:30\. So if we

Me: Okay. Well, I don't know if I do or not. So

Them: Regarding regarding Charlotte,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and the you're about to have at 02:30,

Me: Yep.

Them: You know, again, she's sending me more things that are easily within our capabilities to make but they are not going to get by just taking an an existing you know, similar to tweaking tweaking the URL parameters that go into them that instantiate them, and magically, it's gonna show up that way. And

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I mean, I'm happy to like, I'm happy to do this work. I want to do

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: I wanna do the real design process. And then

Me: Mhmm.

Them: deliver them real software. That's really what I wanna do.

Me: Yeah.

Them: I I don't really love the idea of, like, sort of jamming in in inappropriate random bits in there that may

Me: Mhmm.

Them: may not work or have anything to do with anything. So you know, like, I'd I'd love it if we got the go ahead for that, but but I don't really know I don't really know how to how to pursue that given all the conversations that we've had to date and their desire to

Me: Right.

Them: you know, sign a starter, thing.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: When what they want is not a starter thing. Right?

Me: Yeah. So so, yeah, let's let's break down strategy and what we know we can do and what we wanted to say or not say. We can do. I mean, on the the top level, you know, the thing that she'd sent just the other day, was like, yeah, that's actually feasible, and I talked to Dan about it on the side before she even sent that it was I was like, oh, probably what you wanna do is align those and have this something and, you know, had half of it, you know, designed myself by playing with the JSON for an hour. So, like, yeah, definitely, we can do that. And, definitely, it would be an afternoon if somebody's time to get the JSON right and what have you.

Them: Each

Me: You know? But what we wanna what else they've asked for, what we wanna say, how much we wanna open up the door, or what the strategy is. That's that I think is the really the bigger conversation for us. Yeah. Right.

Them: Well, and did you see the most recent? Like, she sent me

Me: If you send something more?

Them: she sent one Friday or something, Thursday or Friday,

Me: Yeah. That's and that's the one I think is actually, you know, totally

Them: No. Because it's a combination of a

Me: feasible. Let me see.

Them: three d model

Me: Oh, was she I I

Them: of of the land with a layer on top of it that is

Me: right. So what I what I read the oh. Let's see. So initial adjustments. So Yes. So I see that as only the red rectangle. Basically, I'm viewing that three d model as them.

Them: I see.

Me: And the red rectangle as can you tweak that SIM to make that thing vertical so we can embed it as an iframe. That's the way I read that.

Them: I thought she was asking us to do the three d part too.

Me: No. No.

Them: Which which we totally can't. Right? Like,

Me: We could, but not that's not a tweak. You know, that's that's a whole other conversation.

Them: I'm right. Exactly. That's my point. Like, that's my point.

Me: Yep. Yeah. Exactly. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So so if the answer is you know, can you tweak the SIM to look like this instead and then make it

Them: Uh\-huh.

Me: an iframe that we can embed? You know, basically, if like, get rid of the extra stuff besides the SIM and make it vertical. Yeah. Okay.

Them: Oh, yeah. Sure. Fine. Great.

Me: That yeah. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Wonderful. But, you know,

Me: Right. And and and that's the kind of thing I feel like they should be asking for right now.

Them: but

Me: Can you change the JSON file in that thing and strip away the UI?

Them: Well, right. That was the original agreement that we had amongst the technologists in the room.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: But you know, I looked and went, well, yes. I I could, like, use the framework that we had in the Desi Sims to do three d modeling.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And layer on a, you know, a not even lab because in the end, we didn't do that. We made lab light in in JavaScript.

Me: Right.

Them: And that's what we did because Lab itself was too

Me: Right.

Them: large and unwieldy and not fast enough. But you know? So, like, I have demos of

Me: Right. Yep. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: these things. But they're all custom. Right? Like, it's like, okay.

Me: Right.

Them: Let's actually make you the thing that you want. Right?

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel like we should on the the Charlotte side of things, you know, look back the things she sent and and, you know, know what we're bringing to the table. For her, which is like, yes. We can make small tweaks to this this thing and this thing and this thing, and we'll give you a rectangle. And you can do what you want with that rectangle for the the time being, but it's not more than that. Right?

Them: Right. And, you know, you will note that that rectangle that she's on does not have

Me: Yep.

Them: any controls on it. It does not, right, like, allow right? All of these

Me: Asking?

Them: doing is, like, a a little magnifying glass over some portion of the model.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And showing you what's going on, and we would have to send it parameters

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that tell it what part of the three d thing it is looking at and how much energy it is absorbing. If we are not in control of the three d thing. Right? So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, it's not really even just quite as simple as stripping off its UI.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: You know? But okay. Right? Like, I don't know now which of those things

Me: Right. Right.

Them: she's actually asking for. What else?

Me: Right. And I think the strategy part of it is our saying, like, here's what here's where the line is with reasonableness, which is, like, okay. We can can give you two custom ones at temperature a and temperature b.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And you can call up

Them: Mhmm.

Me: you know, with the URL a and URL b or something like that. But it's not gonna be interactive. It's not gonna have a thing that

Them: Mhmm.

Me: changes it dynamically. It's not gonna you know, whatever. Right?

Them: Right. And you know, and I can tell that what what's his name?

Me: So

Them: The dude. Joel.

Me: yeah. So yeah.

Them: Joel? Joel. What what Joel really wants is for me to somehow magically make him

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: a lab editor. So that he can do all of these things and more besides. And I

Me: Mhmm. No.

Them: can't. Right? I can't even do that with most of the engineers who work for me.

Me: Right. Right. Exactly. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: So

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: I you know, it's like a struggle, and I'm like, why are we doing this bullshit? Why can't you just, like, tell give me a thing to do. Let's

Me: Mhmm.

Them: argue for a couple of weeks about what the thing should do. And then I'll make you a thing. It'll be great.

Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know, I I I agree. They're in and I and my guess is they're hamstrung to some degree as well, but, you know, nobody we shouldn't be. But it is where it is. I mean, they're obviously hamstrung themselves if they're using Google Sheets to, you know, run their AI

Them: Yes.

Me: whatever. So

Them: Yes. Yes. I don't, yeah, I don't that organization at all.

Me: yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: Okay. Well, anyway, so

Me: So so, I mean, I've

Them: so we'll figure it out. But

Me: think that I think the asks they have made are I think we can answer those by saying we can give you a rectangle and make it I mean, when you propose that, here's the thing with the sunlight streaming and here's the something I mean, most of those in my eye was hearing us saying, here's a different rectangle than you realized. But it's still a rectangle. And, you know, maybe that house, you know, is shaped a little differently in there because that's a JSON tweak, but it's not more than that. Right? Not functionality, rectangles.

Them: Alright. Right. But every single one of these requests, like, buried in there is the Notion that they can change five different parameters and change the model as

Me: Right.

Them: so such that we're layering multiple, you know, pieces materials, and so on. Like, I feel like she never read the initial write up that I

Me: Mhmm.

Them: hit about. How this project could and should go. And so she's, like, in phase two, and I'm

Me: Got

Them: thought we were in phase one.

Me: Right. Yeah. So that that's probably what we need to recapitulate them if anything is saying, like, okay. We're we could give a couple custom somethings We you know, let every time we're opening the door, we're gonna write down the door we're opening that

Them: Okay.

Me: we can't do and can talk about those things when we wanna open that door. Mhmm.

Them: Right. Right. Right. And I you know, like, I wanna help, but

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: yes. And I don't know why it worked this way last time, but last time we all got together, I thought we were gonna start to ideate

Me: Mhmm.

Them: together about stuff. And instead, what I got was

Me: Right.

Them: forty five minute long demo from Joel about the last thing they did which was very interesting and cool. But didn't really advance the you know, the science much.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So I just need to we need to somehow keep that from happening again.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: This needs to be a conversation where we, like, scope the work and agree on the work.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Or or agree that the work can can get larger. And they will pay for it.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. What so I'm interested in both of those. I'm thinking it through in my head. And imagining that the that mixing, you know, ideation and scoping is probably the recipe for more of the problems that we've been having. So it almost feels like we need to say, like, what what are you asking for? Okay. We can give you 80% of that. Here's exactly you know, we all agree this is the 80% we're giving you. And have another scoping conversation. Let's have an ideation conversation next or something like that. Right?

Them: Right. Right. And these and and it needs to be, like you know, the this on again, off again,

Me: Yeah.

Them: like, oh, we're all busy, and now nobody has time. Right.

Me: Yep.

Them: I mean, we're not getting anywhere, and and we never and we're never gonna.

Me: Yeah. Yep.

Them: Right? We're never gonna unless we have regular, you know, check ins.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And it's gotten complicated now because we're smacking right up against my vacation.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep. Mhmm. Yep. Right. Which is right up against, you know, when they wanna have something as well.

Them: Uh\-huh. Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's right. Like, at this point, we've waited so long that I don't even know who's gonna do whatever thing they think they might want, and I don't know what the thing is that they want.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Like, we we need to start talking more frequently about this, maybe

Me: Right.

Them: even this week. Like, we might need another two of these meetings this week. If I'm going to meet any kind of a deadline for them.

Me: Yep.

Them: And I might need Scott at the next one Right? You know?

Me: Yep.

Them: I mean, this is kind of what I meant about

Me: Yep, think that's right.

Them: not waiting on your schedule because

Me: Right. Yes. Exactly. Totally agree. And and I don't think, you know, I don't think we need to do that, especially when we're into details about this something. I mean, it feels like the answer is ideation should happen after their mid September demo and when you're back. And right now, we're all about, you know, whatever scoping we need to do to get this thing, you know, on its skates before you disappear. Mhmm.

Them: Yep. Yep. Or or just say, you know, okay. Fine. You're gonna manage that, or Scott's gonna manage it or something while I'm gone. Right?

Me: Right. But I but I don't wanna manage it without agreeing to it before, you know, so that it doesn't

Them: Yeah. Right.

Me: creep. So, yes, that's

Them: Right. Okay. So, yeah, continuing with the scheduling theme.

Me: I guess.

Them: I think we have actually canceled two strategy meetings at this point. Because we didn't have one last week. We didn't have one this week, which

Me: Right.

Them: we used to have on the calendar, and now it's

Me: And, yes, and part of that is my annoying schedules that, you know, I was hoping to get one in tomorrow and right now it looks like that may not happen, which is problematic because you're gone. After that. So

Them: So

Me: I I may decide that there's a virtual one for an hour tomorrow if I can get fit it in or something, you know, still this week for

Them: yeah, I I was that

Me: because we we need to do something. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I was very sad to see that disappear off the calendar. And the reason why I

Me: I yeah.

Them: care is that I am rapidly, like, losing memory about what happened at that focus group. Right? Did the thing,

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: and we did the early SWAT, and we did the focus thing. And now we need to, like, bring those two things together and say, okay. So what

Me: Yes. Mhmm.

Them: So now what? And and and if there are holes there that we didn't learn what we needed to learn, then we need to you know, orchestrate another opportunity where we can learn some more things.

Me: Yes.

Them: But but I heard a lot. Like, there's a there's a lot

Me: Mhmm.

Them: to unpack there, and we haven't done it yet. And the longer we beat,

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: the more I don't remember, like, what the hell we talked to.

Me: I told so so yes. Yes. And, and to that question, is that, is that unpacking something that should happen, you know, needs to happen with the whole group, should happen separately, should happen separately, get reported to the whole group? I mean, what's the what's the ideal, you know, grouping and for that? Like, to make it both happen and make it useful. Right? Because it

Them: I mean, I I feel like everybody's

Me: might be separate. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: got good ideas at they'll have a a good take about that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I feel like it is SWAT part two.

Me: Right.

Them: And we spent three hours on that. And

Me: Right.

Them: facilitated it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Which was helpful, you know, almost in ways that I had not even imagined would be true. And you know, and I was like, well, alright. So we'll do this. You know, on last Tuesday's strategy meeting, and then

Me: That's right.

Them: just

Me: Mhmm.

Them: disappeared. So you know, there are other ways to approach this, I guess. We could each individual

Me: No. I

Them: summary notes and try and take from

Me: no. I don't think that's useful. And and it's not that, you know, from my side, my calendar is is, become clearer now too. And so I, you know, I could have a I've got more space for a strategy meeting on my calendar. I could opt to check on others. But it may be that answer is we could actually have one anyway. Because I was in in my head hoping to have one.

Them: Yeah. I mean,

Me: Last week or or hoping to have one when I was knew I had to cancel last week's

Them: right. And so it's gone now, which means that people are are running off

Me: I'm looking I'm looking to see.

Them: doing other things. So

Me: Right. Exactly. But anyway. Okay. Mhmm.

Them: but, yes, I at least would be very happy to see that reemerge. I have a meeting with Michael 09:30 to eleven, but I could get him to back off on that or start it earlier or something. To make more room if I had to.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right? That's just internal people. So

Me: Yep.

Them: but, you know, I know how this goes. The second a giant hole like that

Me: Right, of course.

Them: opens up on the calendar, people start to fill it in with

Me: No, it's not horrible actually. Dan's got a fables meeting Maybe he's got a youthquake meeting. But I think I could, you know, I think I could make an eleven to one slot or 11 to twelve thirty slot that actually works for people. If not, slightly earlier than that. So so, yeah, I think I think it's quite possible we can

Them: Yeah.

Me: make one happen even if it's virtual.

Them: And sort of an overlapping but not identical concern is you know, as as I continue to work with Ethan on this Glue website, right, again, I consider this largely experimental and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: not like other things that we have done. Is it alright for me, for example, to contract an hour of Mike's time to take a look at it, give me some professional marketing feedback about it, Like, is that an okay thing to do?

Me: Yes. Yes.

Them: And then I'm gonna need some users to start looking at it when

Me: Yes.

Them: it's a little bit more fully fledged.

Me: Yes. I think so. I mean, like I said, I think, you I think that's that new clue piece is one that we should be organizing, you know, ourselves of you know, into some kind of even if it's a mini sprint around. So I think we should be putting meaningful resources into figuring out how to portray Clue as an entity in a way that helps us understand real user needs. So yes, definitely.

Them: Okay. Alright. I will I will try and make more progress than just the demo and and the site itself. That I've been picking away at, but, you know,

Me: Yeah. No. I think that's I mean,

Them: like,

Me: yeah, I would say share where you are and, you know, I'm happy to think about the best way to you know, orchestrate that getting it into something that we're getting feedback on and more than just patchwork ways because I think there's there's something real to be had there.

Them: Yeah. And, I mean, that's what tomorrow's meeting with Michael is about, right, at first half of that is, you know, he's been working on a design for a week and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and now I wanna see see what he's got. Have Ethan say, yeah. These things are easy for your heart or, you know, sensible, and we can all you know, see if we can, like,

Me: Yep.

Them: get to the next step. But none of this, of course, is addressing any of Cynthia's concerns about, you know, is she writing is she writing a documentary site, or are we

Me: Right.

Them: you know, marketing more? And and I've been just basically not engaging on that right now because I can't

Me: That's fine. No. I think we need I think you I think I'm I'm clear that we're, you know, trying to write make a product site. And that we sort of don't know what that is yet, but that's why we're making it And it's not a project site. And we'll need we need to follow the lead of what we learn about the product

Them: Right. Right.

Me: to flesh that out more. Mhmm.

Them: You know? Again, not not to say that some of the stuff she's written isn't useful. It is.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: It's just not on the front page, and that's what I'm focusing on at the moment. But yeah. So, anyway, alright. I will I will attempt to, you know, continue to press that forward and try and, you know, hand it off to somebody who can continue to think about it while while I'm gone for a couple of weeks. So that it doesn't just sort of lie fallow. But and the last thing that I think it's important for us to talk about now is just whether whether you and Bill or you with Bill in mind, have any ideas about how to how to define done, I guess, for what he is calling the external beta. And I would call you know, a one point o release.

Me: Exactly.

Them: You know? And when and when we can have a 1\.1 release, which was which is the release in which we start switching. So that when you ask for code app, you get v three and v two.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The list of bugs that are in the internal beta and the public beta buckets are not small, but not insane.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know? Again, we're probably looking for six weeks for two engineers' worth of work. Which I can you know, schedule in September.

Me: And that's and that's the gap between what and what again? It's

Them: Probably. Between where we are today, which

Me: yep. Yep.

Them: is the internal beta, and if you look at the sprints in on the codap board labeled internal beta, which is where I told Zach to put any bugs, that people are reporting and, like, public beta.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Like, those two buckets of of bugs are probably six weeks to engineers, so twelve week twelve weeks of money.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Six weeks of calendar time or something.

Me: Alright.

Them: That we could probably schedule in September and early October. And then if it were me, I would be calling that codab. But I know that that is not Bill's intention. So

Me: Right.

Them: what I

Me: That's but that's yeah. Are those the stories that Bill would also consider marked public beta? In other words, is that period that gets through what he thinks the public beta release

Them: He put him Yeah. He put him there. I mean, I don't act

Me: Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: like, I look at those, and I'm like, the exceptions of the ones that the users reported,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I don't actually care about any of them. You know, whatever. Like, that's what he put there.

Me: Mhmm. Right. Mhmm. Yep.

Them: But then if you if you butt bounce down from there into the bucket that is labeled

Me: I rent a a giant backlog of from hell. Yeah.

Them: Right. Now you're back into to an untractably large backlog.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That really requires some compromises. And I'm not saying that we shouldn't do any of it.

Me: Right. Right?

Them: That's probably wrong too. I'm just saying that we all somehow need to, like, get together and say, here's where the real line in the sand is.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Here is how we are gonna make any choices about any other things that are reported that we don't know

Me: Mhmm.

Them: about now. Right? Like, we need a triage process for me too. Right? Like, you know, I shouldn't be the only voice there. Bill shouldn't be the only voice there. Right? We should be deciding together, oh, we didn't know about this. Seems like it might be important. Let's all agree that it is.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: Or agree that it isn't.

Me: Yep. Yeah. And, you know, and that's a sort of that's a pub sounds like a public beta process is what we're describing that, you know, you're moving making

Them: Right. Right.

Me: your way from beta to whatever, but Gmail took three years and we might yeah. Who else? Right?

Them: Right. Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So

Me: Well, it's heartening to me to you know, to feel like we're both at a place where things are, you know, released and Bill is okay with it being released in some way, parenthetical or not, and that the notion that we could get all of the things that are labeled public beta off of the decks in a way that's not unreasonable time wise. And, you know, that's sort of the point that we've been aiming to get to. So I mean, part of me is inclined to say, okay. Could we actually draw that line and really thick sharpie and say, like, nothing after that until we all, you know, talk and figure out what the process is for anything more besides

Them: Yeah. And I I think I think we ought to practice

Me: books. Yes.

Them: that process as well with the stuff that is in the public bay right now. Right?

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Because it's not infinite but it there's still, like, 50 issues in there. It's big. And

Me: Yes.

Them: do we all agree that every single one of those

Me: Right.

Them: absolutely needs to get done properly? Got it. You know?

Me: Yep. Yep. I yep. Mhmm. Yeah. I think you're right. And I think there's a, you know, there are people have done this before. There are processes by which you, you know, order and, you know, decide on and to balance that portfolio and, you know,

Them: Right.

Me: there's no reason why even if our goal is to get to the end of it, there's no reason we couldn't be you know, trying on one of those processes that says, you know, here's the order in which we do it.

Them: So, I mean, I guess, guess it would be lovely to have a meeting

Me: Uh\-huh. Yep.

Them: where we do this, I don't know, during We have we have a teal sprint planning on Tuesday, tomorrow,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: which Bill is not planning on coming to because, we're primarily doing Amy's stuff

Me: Mhmm.

Them: just at the moment. And and beta's still on know, internal beta is still ongoing anyway.

Me: Right.

Them: So, you know, I'm just kinda waiting for that to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: to settle. But we could probably easily co opt All the flowers in there. Oh, boy. Apparently, they're cutting down a tree across the street

Me: Oh,

Them: destroying the front yard of my husband.

Me: fun.

Them: Unhappy. Yay.

Me: Okay.

Them: So yeah, like, we could co opt that three to four slot

Me: And that you're saying tomorrow or

Them: Yeah. Tomorrow, we could do it I'm still waiting to hear back from Aditi when she wants to talk on Wednesday afternoon, but probably there is time Wednesday afternoon that we could do this.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. And I have a I mean, I've got time with Bill at four on Wednesday that I could, you know,

Them: Oh,

Me: find a time time earlier and then co op that slot, you know, to to prime this with him as well. So I'm I'm happy to to

Them: Yeah. That great.

Me: co op that 04:00 slot with Bill and then see if I can talk to him ahead of time.

Them: Yeah. That'd be great. Right? Like,

Me: Okay. Yeah. Yep.

Them: just to, like, triage triage the the issues that are in

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the top couple of buckets. And then see if we can, you know, agree on a process going forward after we you know, like, if we did all of these, you know, can we call that public beta? And then what would be the process going forward

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's good. Okay. So should I add a new thing at that slot and add more people into it?

Them: Yes. I will warn you that Kirk is on vacation this week because

Me: Of course. Alright. Naturally, as it's August, I have

Them: But, you know, that's okay. I I wouldn't let I wouldn't let that stop you.

Me: Yeah.

Them: You could certainly invite like, Scott in his stead.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Scott, at this point, knows a lot about this project.

Me: Yeah. It'd be good to have Scott involved anyway.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Bill, you, me, Scott, others as well, Michael, Ethan? I don't know.

Them: No. Michael mostly got what he wanted.

Me: Yeah. It it sounds like it.

Them: Astonishingly.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know? He he probably spent more money than anybody was really

Me: Mhmm.

Them: on doing the design, but

Me: Right.

Them: it really looks good, and it looks different, which is nice. Like, it

Me: Yep.

Them: didn't.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Tell which version you're looking at, and people will go, oh, it's a new thing.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. No. I think that's good and actually quite quite good for a beta to be doing that.

Them: Yeah. But so, you know, like, with the exception of just the fact that we kinda ran out of time to implement everything and eventually we need to get around to implementing it.

Me: Mhmm. Yep. What happened on the the sidebar conversation or not or whatever? Know that was a potentially a Jay thing and, you know, overbuilds dead body. We haven't gotten there yet, I assume. Mhmm. The nav bar sidebar

Them: The the the

Me: Right.

Them: the the

Me: Yeah.

Them: the thing. Yeah. So we argued and and then I pointed out that we were arguing over a that would probably take, like, a day of programming. And so he backed off. And then, of course, the developers took too long on the other things and didn't get to it.

Me: Okay. Alright. Fine. Yeah.

Them: They wanna

Me: Yeah. Alright.

Them: stick a fork in my eye. It's alright. It's still out there.

Me: Okay.

Them: There's still that one day, and I'm gonna I'm gonna get it somehow.

Me: Good. Good. Good. Excellent. I'll I'll I'll take that. That's not a problem.

Them: Yes.

Me: Okay. So I've got you, me, Scott, and Bill down there. I'll stick a placeholder in there, and I'll find a

Them: Yeah.

Me: for Bill and myself to meet ahead of time. And then

Them: And then, you know, and if and if we need to then have that meeting every whatever once a month, once every two weeks, whatever, you know, just to, like, triage stuff,

Me: Right.

Them: or agree on what's coming in next, that's fine by me. Right? Because we established some ground rules, and then I'm out a couple of weeks, it won't matter because everybody else

Me: Right.

Them: carry on.

Me: Right. That's good. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. I'm just saying, we need to coordinate before Leslie goes on extended vacation. Good.

Them: Okay.

Me: Okay.

Them: What else?

Me: Let's see. Oh, I did not respond to because I just wanted to ignore it. Latest Sabbath missive Oh, and, you know, I don't know that we wanna decide in real time about that, but, it's been probably a while now. They're probably all on vacation anyway. But

Them: I figured

Me: yeah.

Them: wanted me to do anything about it, that you

Me: I yeah. Well, I wanted you to put in a magic solution that neither of us have.

Them: passed,

Me: And to make it

Them: I

Me: all go away.

Them: I mean, I don't I don't see how we can say other than the things that we I thought pretty clearly said before, which is that they are welcome to run their tests, which are running in the you know, September 25 to to June '26 school year without know, with an agreement or without an agreement or whatever, you know, that's fine with us. But starting with '26, we need to have an agreement that is compensatory in place.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: That's what I meant.

Me: Right.

Them: Right?

Me: Yeah. And and that's I mean, I think so that's what I would wanna say. I think that, you know, things strategically from their side, you know, it's interesting to see that they're saying, well, this is per I mean, well, that's not what I feel like I heard in our first conversation either. That this was per project, I guess, maybe they I guess the project person is thinking, the California thing is one bucket of money and other stuff is another bucket of money. Maybe that's fine for whatever, but it's but but, you know, as soon as we can be compensated, we need to. And I felt like this budget year was the answer. Like, they didn't have money this budget year was what I was envisioning.

Them: Yeah. I thought they said they didn't have budget

Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: last year, which is when they were building the thing. And that by the time we got to September or October, then we were

Me: Mhmm.

Them: on the new fiscal year. You know, then we would then we would figure it out. But they've conveniently forgotten about that.

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: I mean, you know,

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Right. Mhmm.

Them: to me, this is theft. And and I would just say that, look. It was our understanding through previous conversations that we were going to make arrangements to have some kind of compensation going on starting with the '26 school year. Just to be completely clear about timelines. If that's not possible, we recommend that you remove references to our materials from your publications.

Me: Yeah. I'm just rereading.

Them: Software is not free. Pre software is not free.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And I don't care whether you are a professor and you put your curriculum online. In a PDF form, for a book that you've been working on for ten years and neglect to put a copyright notice about on the bottom. If if service picks that up and prints it, that's

Me: Mhmm.

Them: theft. This is not different.

Me: Right. Well, I mean, it so from their standpoint and and, you know, technically, it is in that, you know, if they download it today, and decide that they're using, you know, their clone of the GitHub repository, would be theft, but, you know, we could change that. We could close that tomorrow as well. So, you know, that's a a whole

Them: We we could, but I also don't believe for a second that they have the wherewithal to build this.

Me: no. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

Them: Thing. You know, that's and that's not what the license agreement says. But but, by the way, again, we've been talking about this, like, two years now. If

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: we don't change our agreements to say you can't use this for commercial purposes without you know, without talking to us and signing an agreement.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yep.

Them: You need to do that, like, tom

Me: Right.

Them: Self of this. This is crap.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: And, you know, I'd be happy to think of

Me: Yep.

Them: a draft of you know, like, take a take a first stab at a draft of that letter if you want me to, or or I can just leave it in your hands.

Me: Well, I'm just looking back at their message. It's only been days. I'm gonna let it sit. We're we've got a board meeting on Friday where I'm gonna talk about, you know, this licensing fees with the board, you know, even if that's to make sure that it's on their radar screen. Am I expecting them to, you know, have

Them: Sure.

Me: any anything to say about it, but

Them: Sure.

Me: but then then they know that as well. That lets me come back to them and say, oh, yeah. We talked to our board and something that we can't guarantee we can't guarantee that these licenses are gonna stay the way they are at the very least. So let's make sure MOU is covering your concerns so that you're not you know, hanging yourself off to dry and, you know, that should also be fair and compensatory for us.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: You know? And even if the answer is, you know, in in my view, like, the answer is, yeah, you didn't budget for this in the California back to school 2026, that's fine. Like, let's get a, you know, a licensing percentage And when the money starts to roll in, let's get of that money for us. Like, well, I'm okay to delay that. You know?

Them: Oh, yeah.

Me: Comcast. For a couple years. Give us a give us royalties. Right? Mhmm.

Them: Fine. Great. Yep.

Me: Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, that helps me

Them: Alright. I yeah.

Me: get more resolved on that piece, and I will I'll wait until I won't mail them back till next week so you don't have to worry about it because you'll be gone.

Them: I have

Me: It's all good. Uh\-huh.

Them: Yes. I am work I'm working next week. Next week is weird.

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: I had planned a trip to California to see my sister. So I I'm flipping my day off from Friday to Monday next week, so I'm not here Friday. I'm not here Monday. Tuesday, I'm traveling home. So I'm around and I'm you know, can work, but

Me: I see. So occasional casual correspondence before you completely fall off the map. But

Them: yes. Absolutely.

Me: you know, we're not scheduling not scheduling the three hour meetings or anything. Good.

Them: Yeah. If you and if you need to schedule a

Me: Okay.

Them: three hour meeting, you should schedule it on the twenty ninth because because I used to have that day blocked off, so it's now completely free.

Me: That's good that's good to know. Well, that's the the day I day I'm

Them: Of course it is.

Me: to go up go up to Maine in the afternoon anyway, you don't have to worry don't have to worry too much about that, but all all good.

Them: Yeah. But, like, you know, like, I'm looking at Wednesday, the twenty seventh. Yeah.

Me: Okay.

Them: Afternoon is very open.

Me: Alright. That's good to know. Let's see. Oh, the one thing is I'm just looking at list items. I have a Valhalla report due at the end of the month and I'm wondering the best way to get bullet points on what we've done and what I mean, bullet points literally a paragraph or less on what we've done on the you know, code app side of things. Is that Jira, Kylie, something like, what do you think the best way to get the or maybe it's

Them: Right. Sure.

Me: really just, like, it'd be faster for you to spend five minutes writing a three sentence

Them: Think it's faster for me to just spend five minutes writing down three sentences

Me: sentences. Yeah. Yeah. I think probably. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: about what we accomplished. Right?

Me: Yep. That's great.

Them: I know what's on that list. We do

Me: Exactly. Yep.

Them: we designed a new UI, which we, you know, which we

Me: Yep.

Them: crafted based on user usability test feedback. Ensure that we were, you know, doing the things that we're gonna really help people use the product.

Me: We ran an we ran initial beta. We started

Them: And

Me: official closed beta. We're

Them: Yes. All

Me: moving to an open beta. Yep. Exactly.

Them: All of that. Right. And I can say a few words about, like, the critical bugs that got fixed before we released that beta.

Me: Yep.

Them: Then set. And that's that.

Me: I that'd that'd be great. Yeah. I mean and, literally, they want know, most of the time, like, a a half page for the entire thing. So for fourth sentence,

Them: Sure.

Me: would be great.

Them: Sure. Let me let me open up the Google Doc that will let me do that. Before I forget. No. Okay. I'll

Me: Okay.

Them: do that before the end of the day.

Me: Great. And then let's see. We could talk about this tomorrow, presuming this strategy meeting is doesn't have problems I didn't see on the calendar. But it you know, it feels like to me there's you know, I'm repeating this, but it bears repeating. You know, there are these I feel like there are three modes of of user discovery. One is the kinds of gathering focus groups, call them what you will, that we've been doing, and I think there's more of those to come, hopefully. If some of these, you know, conferences coming up. And I'm talking to Amy about Kentucky this afternoon as a possibility.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I feel like there are there's some subset of things. Maybe it's just pick one where we're drilling in and having, you know, lots of fifteen minute user conversations about a thing, and I think yet to be determined. But, you know, there's at least one or two of those that we could, you know, run forward on and get experience. And then I think there's one or two sprint weeks in there somewhere, and the the clue feels like one that's teed up as a let's make a product, you know, for a

Them: Yep.

Me: thing. And I don't know on the first of those three exactly what it means to play out in the next three conferences into some version of what we did there and or to to know others, but that's one of the outcomes of the discussion tomorrow is, okay. What's what's next How do we replicate this? And Okay.

Them: Yes. Alright.

Me: Alright.

Them: And and the best well, I think the best way to make sure that people are prepared to have the conversation that you want them them to have tomorrow is to attach Dan's notes

Me: Mhmm.

Them: about like, I know I know he's got the notes that he typed

Me: Right.

Them: I know he's also got Granola notes, and I'm not sure if I ever saw those. But

Me: Mhmm.

Them: like, those should be in the meeting request as should the outcome, like, summary of the previous SWOT analysis stuff.

Me: Right. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: Because that's the idea. Like, we should be putting those two things together and arriving at some conclusions about you know, okay. Now now that we've solidified our notion

Me: Mhmm.

Them: around what the opportunities are,

Me: Right. What are we what are we learning? What are we still

Them: you know, Right.

Me: on? What what questions do we have now? What, you know, what's guiding the the next one of these somethings? And

Them: Right. That's right.

Me: yeah.

Them: That's right. And are we waiting until October to have it, or

Me: Right.

Them: we need to find some other way?

Me: Yeah.

Them: Happen?

Me: Yep. Exactly. You know, and I'll loop with Kylie in the meantime about trying to it's a separate strand to get somebody to help you know, roll this forward for us, but that's I've been neglecting that for the last week or two. Because I think, you know, if we if we have a a RIC for users or user discovery, I think we're gonna move a lot. More concertedly. Okay. Great. Okay. And let's see. Last thing just calibrated before I'm googling sorry. So Charlotte again before we have the break and then see ourselves again at this conversation. So let's see, I'm looking at Charlotte initial document. Okay. Fine. And then we were responded to that. And then she came back and said, son on the ground lab rated a viewing of a house from the sun. So I think we should go in with the assumption that they're talking about two rectangles. One rectangle being the sun with the ground

Them: Mhmm.

Me: vertical instead of horizontal. And another being some version of that streaming in, you know, thing to the energy two d. And we're talking from our point of view, we're to we're assuming JSON changes to those things. And, you know, that we're giving them a rectangle you know, or a couple different rectangles with slightly different parameters. But, you know, not, you know, rectangles with massive controls and not big changes and not three d environments or what have

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm. Okay.

Them: Although, again, I do want I want a moment or two to show them

Me: Yeah.

Them: some things that we already made for Desi that

Me: Yeah.

Them: look just like what they're trying to

Me: Yeah. That's great. Yeah. And I'll totally leave that to you. Like I said, I'm

Them: do.

Me: I'm trying to I'm saying this as much so I don't open up scope inadvertently as I tend to do, and I'm I'll I can shut up whenever you're, you know, taking the screen, which is more more time than me.

Them: Yeah. And again, written these are

Me: So that you can you can open whatever doors you wanna open up, but I'm I'm to make sure I don't open up more doors without my mouth doesn't open more doors than I'm checking package.

Them: Right. Right. Right. No. All of this all of this is with the with the understanding that if they did have us do more things like this,

Me: Yep.

Them: you know, that it's now now we're making an actual custom SIM for them, and now we're into the 50 k range instead of the 30 k range.

Me: Right. Yep. Yep. Exactly.

Them: Right. You know?

Me: That's great. Okay. Excellent. I will let you open up those doors and then we're on the understanding that two rectangles is our until until they tell us differently and we

Them: Right.

Me: respond.

Them: Right.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right.

Me: Okay. Great. I will see you at that call.

Them: Alright. See you.

Me: Take care. Bye.
