Transcript:

Me: Hello?

Them: How things

Me: Fine. It can be faster so we don't have to worry about your call interrupting us necessarily. Working on proposal right now and working all that you choose on the letter for. Thank you very much. We're submitting that tomorrow morning.

Them: Good.

Me: And I'm just putting finishing touches on it now. It's relatively straightforward because it's a resubmission of of follow on to the one that we have right now. Which long story, we submitted a phase two at first, and then they told us to do a phase one, and we got that. And now this is the phase two again. So

Them: Good.

Me: interestingly, the I was mailing Kathy FET because we had some questions because they had a phase two earlier that we knew was can't was terminated. And asked them questions about what they did for evaluation. And said they are working on resubmitting their phase two now with changes avoid the termination. So it's you know, we're all interested in the same kinds of things. So

Them: It

Me: So that's that. Mean, I think the biggest sort of news that is news and isn't at the same time is the the NSF changes or or in solicitation which you may or may not have caught wind of. So they on Friday afternoon, literally hours after the board meeting, of course, put out their new fiscal twenty six grant solicitation which archived for the four sort of most major programs in education funding that they've had on the books, put one new one out that's a program called a solicitation, so it's more general and rolling.

Them: Archive means no no solicitation.

Me: Yes. Archive means it says archive when you go visit the website and not a not a

Them: That means

Me: and said,

Them: count.

Me: gone. Right. Exactly.

Them: Commit.

Me: And and the total amount on this new running one is 30,000,000, I think, where the total across everything before was a 140\. So it's somewhere like 25% of the overall funding for EDU. This submission this solicitation is tilted toward AI and emerging technology. So that's good for us in, you know, a lot of ways. I don't know what it's gonna mean for everybody else except a lot of AI slot proposals. I'm sure that they are trying to use for something that, you know, they didn't mean to know, use it for. Is I mean, I talked to one program officer early on this week and haven't talked to more yet. You it's congress obviously hasn't said anything about money one way or another.

Them: Our

Me: He said they had to make this call because

Them: our proposal's sitting, waiting. Are they in the they're in the categories that are now archived, but that

Me: That doesn't seem to be the issue.

Them: Those categories that doesn't issue?

Me: Right. Well, so this is fiscal twenty yeah. Fiscal twenty funding that they're, you know, putting this solicitation out for.

Them: Well, you never know. Sure. Sure. Sure. I just

Me: So all the other things are in there and that

Them: I just wonder how it will impact the judgment

Me: yeah. Yeah. So we have seen awards for the

Them: Kinda read the tea leaves.

Me: programs. So in the last couple days, we know somebody who got a d r k 12\. Danny Yiddleston was just posting literally a minute and five minutes ago that they got an Azul proposal, which is the first Azul proposal award people have heard of. So it's not as if all of a sudden they are not issuing awards in those programs. And they really it wouldn't make sense for them to do that because

Them: I mean, they have to send.

Me: that money is already twenty five money that's sitting there waiting to be spent, and they don't gain anything by trying to not. So, yeah. So the complication is what mean, there's calculus around submitting is what's the actual pool of funding for this, because you know, they are anticipating this to some degree. Program officer I talked to said, you know, they had to make this call so that people wouldn't start submitting proposals to programs that would never get funded, they had to pull those back in some way.

Them: Right.

Me: I think it's debatable whether they need to do that. And out a move that seems very aligned to the administration budget as opposed to whatever, you know, congress will or won't say.

Them: I'm good. Do something else, but then they can put out more solicitation. Yeah.

Me: Ex exactly. Yeah. He said they, you know, this person was somewhat cynical, but also very forthcoming. And he said there's sort of internal assumption that there'll be a continuing resolution within NSF. Mostly because they have been before. Which mean you know, think would mean maybe more funding. I don't know if that what that means for education. He said last time they got a CR, they didn't get their numbers until December, so it definitely would mean delay on other kinds of things.

Them: Right.

Me: Maybe this is a foot in the door for them to be able to be accepting awards even if there is a continue continuing resolution. So as as much unknown is known, definitely competition right now is higher than before although skewed in some odd ways that might benefit us.

Them: 10\.

Me: There is also

Them: And none of the none of our this year's ones have come through yet?

Me: was that Not yet. Although we have seen an uptick continue from last Friday. There have been a 100 awards in the last three days as of this morning. Which is, you know, 30 or more a day, which is continue, like, a significant more than there had been before. So

Them: And we've got a month.

Me: that's, you know, hopeful at least. We got a month. Exactly. Yep. So hopeful that that, you know, is a sign that things are continuing to unstick And I think the one other piece of funding news that I think is also positive there, there was a Dear Colleague letter issued for existing projects in education that are AI related or use AI in So, basically, if you have a proposal that already is doing AI stuff, you can get a supplemental

Them: So you have some

Me: for it. And we have a good number of those. So, you know, talking to program officers,

Them: of those?

Me: about those to try to to, you know, get our our foot in the door and, you know, claim some of the money that's out there on mean, that's not 10 projects, but it's, you know, at least three, four, five, upon how you decide to to frame it. And so we ought to be able to to make a a decent case for those

Them: Good. Will help.

Me: And that hopefully can be, you know, some money that we could pin down as well. So, you know, that's I mean, it's it's not great. I think if you are a researcher who doesn't think about technology at all, you're really stymied right now. And, you know, so we should maybe count our blessings that we're in a place where it's all technology oriented. And our things will if framed well, will rise above the people who are generically using LLMs, but it's still, you know, less money than anybody wants in lots of ways. And and you know, problematic like that. So

Them: Okay.

Me: so, yeah, that is what it is. We're moving forward on it. Our you know, Danielle is starting on Tuesday. We are got our first week or two for meetings and connections with staff planned out generally. We have a a an internal sort of ideation brainstorming meeting a week from Tuesday. To gather the you know I gather ideas, circle wagons, and and to kind of start to put out both people toward writing proposals as sooner rather than later because this is rolling now. And to make sure that we're strategizing together so we don't have seven people off writing the same thing or, you know, we find out we're submitting 16 proposals when they're only gonna accept 30, you know, that kind of thing. So coordinating PIs and and writing. And what else was I gonna say? Oh, and I'm working on, you know, internal conversations on AI. How did a good long conversation with Scott and Leslie about sort of infrastructure dream. Like, what if we as the developer people and architects, could write the the ticket for what we need for infrastructure that would set us up. You know, what are the things the PIs won't ask for because they know to ask for it. But if we don't build it, to prepare ourselves, then we're not gonna be you know, the the interstate highways aren't gonna be there for us when we, you know, wanna do real AI stuff. And I think there's funding existing in hand that is not particularly associated with the project. And if these new projects come in, some chunks of that funding as well that we can claim early on to try to do some of that groundwork so that when we propose things, we can relatively quickly turn out into some meaningful things that other people can't do. So that's my my main help.

Them: So what about the definition on the web of our open source license or permission to use.

Me: How

Them: Any prog

Me: we talked about it at our strategy meeting with the team on

Them: on including that?

Me: Tuesday. We didn't have time to to get into depth on it. You know, Leslie and I have started to to process some different know, layers of it. I am sending a response to the service folks probably beginning of next week to say and we check that in with somebody else who's in you know, we've been working within this consultant in publishing. We said, yeah. Like, that's not how you work. Should, you know, definitely push back. So we're, you know, we're laying, you know, we're laying the groundwork to say, no. No. No. It doesn't work like that. And even if it's open source, it doesn't work like that. But, you know, also to say and you know, licensing isn't gonna be that simple.

Them: Yep.

Me: So so we're we're we're starting that

Them: I thought all open source licenses said you are free to use it for yourself, but if you're using it commercially,

Me: No. There's lots of different kinds. And the ones that are most used in the, you know, sort of general open source world are the ones that say, it for whatever you want, you know, commercially friendly because it it does get pretty nuanced when you're in this place of are you you know, is this commercial or not down the stream, three layers? Is that, yeah, kind of thing?

Them: Right.

Me: The one the usually, what people do is you choose a license that says, you can use this as long as the things you use it in have the same license. So basically if you want to use this it will make your code open source if it wasn't already. And that is often enough of a sort of, no go for companies

Them: Area.

Me: that then they will come back to you and say, alright. Fine. But can I have a different license for this? Can you give me a friendly, you know, version of that license? So that that would be one of the kinds of options that we could take, and there are very you know, of all kinds within it.

Them: And that seems like a fairly straightforward one.

Me: It can be depending upon, you know, again, it could be that the answer is this is MIT licensed and free for use as long as you don't make less than a certain amount.

Them: Yeah. I think You can you can make deals once you have something like that.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: And

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so that's what you need is that first step. It's not free for everybody anytime.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: And getting that done Have you talked to a lawyer?

Me: I haven't yet no I've been working on this proposal so I'll start to them moving next week once this is submitted. Mhmm.

Them: I think this is pretty urgent.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But, yeah, because you're doing this service, that makes it urgent. Right?

Me: Yeah. Right. Yep.

Them: Okay.

Me: Mhmm. So so that's mostly what's going on. You know, we'll we'll this forward. We'll get our development director in place. I'm you know, I talked to our funders from Valhalla. This afternoon and let them know that we wanted the money for coaching to think about user discovery prioritization. She was looking for some names from me as well. So hopefully, in the next few weeks, we'll get that rolling at the same time. And then we'll get to proposals ASAP. So

Them: You're sounding a little croaky.

Me: yeah. I my my wife is one day ahead of of me in this and, you know, is starting to recover more from it and you know we are hoping that that accelerates because we have a family family wedding in kind of Angkorot, Maine tomorrow afternoon that we're leaving for. My in laws just arrived for, so we're actively not testing for COVID and just hoping that all gets better and just moving forward.

Them: Okay. Good.

Me: So yeah. Alright. Well, I'll keep you informed. Hopefully,

Them: Anything else I should know?

Me: hopefully, there's more to say on the the grant front. Like I said, several of our colleagues are just you know, are have been getting news the last couple days. So it's feeling like, you know, people we know are getting, you know, yeses on things. And, hopefully, that'll be us as well.

Them: It Well, good luck. Let us know, of course.

Me: Certainly will. Alright. Take care. Good luck with the vet.

Them: K. Thank you.

Me: Bye.

Them: Bye.
