Transcript:

Me: Hello, Jie Chao. How are you doing? I'm fine. How are you? I guess I've seen you once since you've been been back but I I never heard of your your take on how much Beijing has changed since you were last there. Was it as much a wonder world as before, if not 10 times more? What's the did you recognize

Them: Yeah.

Me: thing?

Them: It is very very high energy, vibrant. Yeah. It's hard to describe.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The level of advancement since I left in 02/2007\. Right?

Me: Oh my god. Right. I'm sure that's

Them: Almost like

Me: true.

Them: almost twenty years. It has been a lot, and

Me: Were you in Beijing then? Know, what's what's your connection to Beijing proper? Is that where you grew up? I forget.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Okay.

Them: That's my hometown. Grew up

Me: Okay. Wow.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So, I mean, a populate I mean, like, other qualifications, population wise, is it 10 x, or what's the

Them: Population wise, I don't know. Let me check. I think it's somewhere

Me: And it feels like

Them: because

Me: population is sort of meaningless when it comes to China anyway because it's just a lot. It's it's always

Them: yeah.

Me: answer. So it might not be the right measure. Maybe maybe average building height or something is a better metric. But Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. It's probably 30\.

Me: K.

Them: Feeling.

Me: Okay.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Now

Them: Yeah. Oh, well, I I think that's kinda combination of people who are who are the citizen who are the, you know, Beijing like, Coast Plus, there's a lot of people

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: migrant to the city to work.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But in recent years, a lot of people have left Beijing because the it just the cost of living is doesn't make sense anymore.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But it's still a humongous humongous

Me: I'm sorry. Uh\-huh.

Them: city. Yeah.

Me: Wow.

Them: And, yeah, there's a in terms of education, it's pretty overwhelming. Everywhere you go, there's extracurricular programs. You go to the mall, like,

Me: But

Them: here, you you don't find any educational stuff in the mall.

Me: these lurkeys are at the mall here. Yeah. Right.

Them: But but in Beijing, every mall, first of all, there's two levels of restaurants. Right? People love food. And then two levels of just all kinds of educational program. You can find tennis, boxing, skiing,

Me: Ow.

Them: Like, they have a skiing simulator. And all sorts of dancing program and art program and a place where you can you can hang out with cats and dogs and little pet

Me: Wow.

Them: pet parks. It's you know, very, very well developed.

Me: Wow. Uh\-huh.

Them: All kinds of places you can spend money on.

Me: Wow. Wow. That's fascinating. And

Them: Pretty overwhelming. Yeah. If you go to Beijing, just hang out

Me: absolutely crazy.

Them: in one mall building. Usually, it's, a five or a Seventh Floor. You can pretty much get everything you want. Oh, and then there's also a a nice supermarket and a underground level, usually.

Me: Mhmm. Of course.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Wow. That's fascinating.

Them: My kids really love it, and they don't wanna come back.

Me: I'm sure. Yeah. Right.

Them: Yeah.

Me: That's very cool. Wow. Well, I'll I've experienced it vicariously for now, but I'll have to I've gotta go before too long to

Them: Yeah. If you do, go to China, definitely, I

Me: get a real test.

Them: be aware of the crowd.

Me: I'm sure

Them: The crowd is everywhere. You do wanna avoid summer summer break. It's a bad idea.

Me: Is it summer summer is also the same break? I mean,

Them: Yeah.

Me: do schools have a three month break there also? Or

Them: Yeah. I think it starts in early, early July.

Me: okay.

Them: July and and,

Me: Okay.

Them: end of the August. So it's two months of summer break. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So that that's really peak time. And

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: for the major attractions, it just is so overwhelming. The the number of people out there.

Me: I'm sure.

Them: I know we went to the Forbidden City, you know,

Me: Oh, wow. Mhmm.

Them: Have you seen pictures or videos of Forbidden City? It looks like the largest the pilot's probably on Earth. From documentaries, it looks all, like, very very lofty. Right? But if you actually go there for for a half day, trip, it feels like a crowded supermarket. I get people everywhere. And then staff member, they're using the big microphone and they're shouting at everybody, Go forward. Don't linger.

Me: Interesting. Wow.

Them: But that kind of, you know, experience on its own, I guess, is a is a attraction.

Me: I guess so. Yeah. But it's, you know, different style than the

Them: And you'll see a lot of people they dress like the Qing dynasty. People are wearing big hats and then walking around. There's so many, like, prince and princesses walking around you.

Me: Alright. Of course. Uh\-huh.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Tourism tourism in your own city. That's crazy. Wow. Well, it's fascinating. But

Them: Yeah.

Me: Glad you got back so you can relax at home in the summer.

Them: Very relaxing. It's a lot of work to just

Me: Wow.

Them: plan everything and implement and handle the uncertainty on the road.

Me: Right. I'm sure.

Them: Okay. So,

Me: So, yeah, what's on what's on your mind as you're returning to, you know, reality and crazy school year, etcetera?

Them: Yeah. Well, these two weeks are just working on some conference proposals, writing up for the story q two project And as I was right, and, of course, I look at

Me: Right.

Them: most recent literature. AI education, especially in the

Me: Right.

Them: in my strand, which is teaching AI topics, in

Me: Alright. Yes.

Them: core classes, like math class or English. Also getting a lot a lot more people getting into that space.

Me: Okay.

Them: Yeah. So but we our our projects still stand out in the sense that we are taking a whole school approach. We bring a set of modules the school and require teachers from

Me: I see. It's not just in one subject. It's unpackaged.

Them: department to work together

Me: Mhmm.

Them: to bring to bring out the, the whole learning experience for the same cohort of students. But I my my general take is everywhere we look, it's getting crowded. People are getting to the space because anything to do with AI is

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: drawing attention nowadays. But we don't want to just, you know, stay away from this field.

Me: Yeah. You can run. You can't necessarily you know, you've gotta

Them: Yeah.

Me: differentiate to some degree and and be in the pool and

Them: Almost like it's just a know, computer. When computer becomes more prevalent. Right?

Me: mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: And and then everywhere you look at the instructional design or educational technology research, it's gonna be how can we use computers in different ways.

Me: Right. Mhmm. Exactly.

Them: Yeah.

Me: I mean, I do think there's room for differentiation. It sounds like you're you know, identifying some cases where that might already be the situation, and there may be be others. I mean, sort of quality can be different differentiation of

Them: Yeah.

Me: like, differences or different types of things or new new takes on things be another differentiator, and there are probably others too.

Them: I I I think it's gonna be

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: more and more challenging. That's why I mentioned you know, where do we wanna stand in the crowd kind of idea I personally feel a little bit scared getting into the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: mainstream market. Because we're kind of don't don't have a lot of experience in in that space.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And, of course, if we try hard enough, I think we can probably take a piece of pie somewhere, right? But is just difficult. But I but I think our strength is really the ability to to work with STEM professionals, STEM researchers to bring the very frontier into the classroom.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: I think in the AI space, at least my personal strategy will still be go look for the frontier where no educators or no educational researchers are even thinking about that space yet.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Take topic from there to the classroom to teachers.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Otherwise, if if you look at anything that's already written in some sort of AI education framework or AI for k 12 framework, the contents is already laid out there.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And somebody will do it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Somebody will do it.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: And non non for profit or for profit or just, you know, co.org, they'll they'll they'll look at the center. Oh, this is where our supposed to teach. Let's make some curriculum materials, and let's teach teach teachers good.

Me: Right.

Them: Then you have, you know, nothing left to do.

Me: And so and and when you're describing that, at least one relevant is helping me understand is within the realm of AI education, which is to say that, you know, we've there's a lot of well trod ground in the what's already known about what you might need to know about AI. But, you know, are there frontier topics or frontier approaches or frontier some things that, you know, nobody's tackled yet in terms of teaching kids about

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. That's a gift that keeps on giving as long as long as you don't don't get too asterisk, but I think you can always bring it down and know, complexify or danger in saying, like, here's what it is, you know, is that all of a sudden you're left with five weeks on machine learning and, like, nobody wants it anymore. Right? So

Them: Yeah. Let's try it. I think, the Neural Netmaker is

Me: Mhmm.

Them: a good example of that because we are working with the very frontier of natural language processing, the The concept that we explore in that project is so called neuropathway. Which is sort of like a component factor analysis. If you look at all the neural network, people understand neural network in terms of what exactly it learns. It people usually the answer is you learned well, the the the model learned all these, you know, weights. Right?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's just not really

Me: Right.

Them: a lot of sense to or what do you mean a lot of weights? Right? That's just a something that changed within the machine. So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the concept of neuropathway is a attempt to extract some patterns in those neuron activation, And those patterns will start to make sense. To humans eyes. Maybe they are more correlated with quality, some some attributes of the data that that we already know. And and then they may represent some higher level attributes that's hidden in the data set.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So so by examining those neural pathways, we're able to truly speak about

Me: Mhmm.

Them: what exactly the model learned,

Me: And is that the

Them: in human sense.

Me: is that the goal of neural pathway work is really to sort of be able

Them: Yeah. It's in the realm of the

Me: interpret and general generalize too. But

Them: explain explainable AI or interpretability of AI.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Which is always a very controversial, area.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because 99% performance.

Me: But Mhmm.

Them: But what exactly it's performing based on is questionable. So so so so my my collaborator, her her doctoral students, dissertation, which inspired the whole project. Is looking at these AI generated versus human written essays. Right? So so the task is to distinguish between AI generated

Me: Mhmm.

Them: essay versus human written essay. Which is very important thing to do. Right?

Me: Certainly.

Them: But the model performs very well, and but the question is, is it really between AI, generated text versus human origin text. And turns out,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the neural pathway that that a graduate student extracted has a very high correlation with another property of those task The property is whether the essay was written by non native speaker versus native speaker. Turns out non native speaker

Me: Interesting.

Them: writes more like AI generated text, which is not surprising if you think about it because it looks

Me: Right. Right. I don't have as much to draw from, right, because they

Them: by the book. Right? We learn to follow the grammar. More than native speaker. So so then non native speaker get penalized because sometimes their text their their essay will be erroneously detected as RNA generated assay. So

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: what the model really learned to distinguish between non native speaker versus a native speaker, at least a big component of the learned concept is about that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Not so much about AI versus human.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. So that's that's a very important fairness or ethical aspect of AI. What we're using AI even though the performance is sup superb. But whether it's really fair

Me: Mhmm.

Them: it's questionable. It's really what exactly it's understanding.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. So so I wanted to do more kind of work

Me: That's great.

Them: like that. Because I think that's not something that people would easily

Me: Mhmm.

Them: just try to pursue in the first place. Right? They don't go out there to look for very hard topic that just on the surface of it look like too advanced for middle school or high school to even think about. Because if you look at it, you say, oh, they need to understand network. They need to understand all these prerequisites Where do we find those kids? There's no such kid exist.

Me: One, Yeah. No. I think I so I think that's great, and and that's really helpful in helping me interpret your zero to one, analogy and where to to go. And, you know, and I think it it is so I think two things from that. One, it's really well matched to building on the work that you've been doing, and I I think there's a a a niche there. I fully agree with you on that entirely. I think it is you know, I would recharacterize some of the conversation I'm pushing around. You're discovery, what have you. And even some of the questions there to say that I don't think that they are mutually exclusive from the work that you're doing, I think the ends that might come from it, you know, are different in in the case that you described versus maybe some others. But that's just, you know, within you hone the process. So for example, you know, what you're describing I think I think that the secret sauce there is precisely what you're, elucidating, which is that there's a domain there of cutting edge AI applications understanding or what have you that can be tilted toward learning for kids, that other people aren't don't have the connections to reach or don't willing to or don't have the innovation or what have you to to get in, that's a that's a carved out space. Actually a carved out arc. You know, any one of these things is a carved out arc, which is to say there is a portion of that arc that is something that is, you know, we imagine could be useful There's a portion of the arc that's sort of, you know, that maybe is more closely attuned to, an actual need in a classroom. And the dirty secret I was laying out a month or whatever it was is that NSF doesn't really care where you are on that arc. Because as long as it's an innovative arc in some way and it and the panelists agree, then you're fine. The interesting question is, can we find anything about the ARC that might make it resonate even more with other people people's needs or what have you so that you get that thing, it's more than just researchers saying it's cool and not saying it's just that. But, like, the the number of people, you know, saying, oh, that actually fits my needs is even better. It's a little bit more narrow in in the sense that you're describing because really, the innovation is the thing most in 80% of the the value of what you're describing. So it kinda matters less, I think. But it but, you know, you could certainly you could certainly imagine cases where neural pathways hit home with a small subset of teachers and another framing in which they hit home with more because you realize that it's about bias. And people are like, oh, yeah. I wanted to do about bi I don't know. Right?

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think the question we are all searching answer for is

Me: Of course.

Them: where do we position ourselves? A lot

Me: Yep. Completely.

Them: of decisions are about

Me: Mhmm. Exactly.

Them: about this. I just don't want us to become one of the, you know,

Me: Yeah.

Them: provisions on the market that that people can't really put a finger on you. What exactly are you? Are you a like, right? So so so when we decide to

Me: Mhmm.

Them: come out to be on the market, I think we should have a clear identity. And that identity is established by some flagship

Me: Mhmm.

Them: product.

Me: Yeah, I think so. And I think the I think that the so I hear your concern about, you know, becoming vanilla commodity. Producer. I'm I'm I can say this blindly. Sure. But I'm not concerned about that because I don't think we could do that if we tried. Like, we're so far over on the innovators that I think that know, we would aim for that and miss by a a mile. I think if anything, the problem to some degree, right, is that right now people are asking that question, what are you? You know, are they looking at us? And we don't necessarily I mean, we're people who do innovative things that a few people know about. Might be one argument. That's unfair. But, you know, but but I think the other side is, like, the thing that makes me feel confident is actually more that I think we have a pretty solid brand with the people who use us, which is like you're doing solid innovative stuff that actually you know, I see where you're going with it, and, about it so much. I wanna make time in my classroom to use it. I think that that group is narrower than maybe it could be, but I don't know that we're expecting that that means that then we need to broaden it so much that, you know, every teacher in the world is not every teacher's gonna get what we do or want to take the time or energy for it.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Me, interesting thing is are there other things in that sort of innovation space that we have unfair access to? We have an unfair advantage in being able to get NSF money. And being able to think about innovation and being able to move our technology forward. So how do we use that unfair advantage, you know, as a new start up mentality, whatever? And can we do that in are there opportunities out there with the people need, you know, answered or helped that to be helped with something that was innovative. And we draw lines between that and the innovation something. That when we propose something to NSF, we have a little bit more inkling that the thing that comes out the other end is gonna serve some felt need in the world. Think most of the things that we do are still in that know, proposed NSF innovative bubble in one way along the arc or another. We're not gonna make, you know, better math quizzes. You know? Like, that's I don't think we could do that, and I think we'd all get bored in about ten minutes. So

Them: Mhmm.

Me: so yeah. But I think I do think that there are I mean, I think there are two layers of that, like, how do we learn what people need I think the most salient one is just. That if we if we have a little better sense of what people's needs and, and pain points are, then the things that we come out at the other end with are gonna have more impact just by the nature because they started in a more resonant space. I also think that there probably are product categories for life or a pretty crude term or something that are not being explored because people don't have the innovations to draw from. So I think we might be able to go some of the other direction too. Like, what the hell do we use glue for besides some abstract something for our teachers? Well, maybe there are or three things out there that we never discovered that we could solve, you know, and because we've got the tools we do them. None of those are making potato chips for the masses. I don't think that we can do I mean, we could certainly do that, but we'd fail in a second and it wouldn't even be fun.

Them: Yeah. I was thinking about

Me: Mhmm.

Them: codap. I think codap is has the strongest foundation and the user base

Me: Mhmm.

Them: to become something like

Me: Mhmm.

Them: scratch. Or or App Inventor.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right? Because it is a very

Me: Mhmm.

Them: generic tool. You can you can do a lot of things with this. It's very open. You know, any kind of data and all sorts of ways to visualize data to tell data stories, writing maybe journal articles about data or things like that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Would that be something that we because if you look at the scratch or app inventors, they don't come from the direction looking at what teachers are you know, concerned about or challenge that they experience in the classroom? There's no nobody will tell that story. Oh, we don't have it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Scratch.

Me: Right.

Them: App human to use. Right?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: From the the opposite direction, they really come from the learners perspective. What would be engaging support, empower people to make stuff?

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: Make animations, to make apps. And then those values that learners experience they would push up the educators community to see this is my my students want it. This is what my after school program or extracurricular program, we can sell. Scratch based program.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Like, have smart cams right here. It's, like, $900 per week just teach kids how to do Scratch or Minecraft.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. No. I and and I think it, you know, I think it goes

Them: Yeah.

Me: I think both of those are sources. Know? And and they're not separated from one another. You know, the you know, you don't pay $900 to take your kids to a camp they're not gonna like. But you're taking them to a camp for a reason that serves you. Like, you don't do it all year long. You do it because your kids are sitting around the in the summer and don't have anything to do. So there's some decision maker layer that's involved, and you're solving some problem for them. But you're not doing it in a way that's unsatisfying for everybody. I think that the discussions can come mean, it's hard to get kids in a room They're not quite gonna tell you whether and we we have, you know, different different entries to that. And, also, unfortunately, in today's educational system, they're not the decision makers. You have In some way, you have to get at the educators. But really I think the kinds of questions we ask need to be tilted toward that even more educators. And we need to look at students. When somebody says, I'm gonna rewrite that open side unit, they're doing it because their kids aren't engaged probably. So, actually, my question is really, like, what do you what problem are you solving? And, like, what what's three layers underneath there? Like, when I did this, my kids oh, okay. Tell me more about what that day was that you designed for the sun. Because I'm listening for the engagement for the kids and how the teacher saw it in some way, you The research about teacher change shows that teachers change when they see their kids engaged Right? I mean, that's pretty much the only time they'd ever ever really change is when they a difference that happens in their kids. So yeah, 100%. And how do we get at that thing that they're also willing to to buy, you know, to take off shelf and put in front of their kids because every one of those days is an investment choice somebody made for their classroom.

Them: So so is is the science curriculum market is is what we're

Me: I don't know.

Them: thinking about.

Me: I mean, I don't know at all.

Them: This point.

Me: Mean, I definitely think that we are you know, not product sellers. You know, I I think if we made something that we saw was filling a niche, somebody else would have to have the phones in sales or we have to go through somebody else in some way or another. I don't think that we can start there to answer the questions either. I think that we have a pretty innate sense for some level of what makes for good for what was good education. And some level makes good sort of classroom experience.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And, you know, I don't think we have a good sense for what teachers what resonates enough with decision makers that they will buy it more broadly. I think we have a we we've got signal that we should listen to more to see, like, what is it within the things that people love that that resonates to some degree. And I think there are problems where those pieces fit together. So, like, the open side conversation is really interesting to me because there is a train that people are on that they don't entirely like, but we know that lots of people are on that train. And so if we can see that, like, there's a dining car that could be made better, You know, lots of people are already on the train. Like, if we can make a better dining car, then we might actually get people and have a big impact in So is there an opportunity within the fact that open site exists, but is, you know, missing somewhere people that we could take our particular expertise and you know, answer some question within. The answer might be no and abandon that, and there are lots of other problems out there in the world. I don't know. But, that one is interesting because if the answer were yes or sort of yes, there are a lot of people using ultrasound, so we could amplify that signal and figure out what subset of them actually liked the things that we have to do. And then we're getting more like, then our philosophy gets out to more people in a way that's meeting them where they stand. Mhmm.

Them: I do want to know more of how we're thinking about this because in the mass education space, it's kind of the similar or even even

Me: Right.

Them: even worse.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: This kind of version of it, there's a lot of top down adoption curriculum, like illustrated mass or there's, like, many different kind of large mass curriculums. Almost I see nowhere that especially for very traditional course, like algebra one, two, geometry, There's just so many

Me: Yep.

Them: curriculums out there. People rarely do, like, create their own thing.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So for me, it's almost like, okay. Do are we thinking about competing with the entire curriculum, or or find a a very popular curriculum, say, illustrated math.

Me: Right.

Them: Okay? And then look through all of it and then and then and then think about where we can supplement

Me: Yeah. I mean, those are all the kinds of questions that, you know, that I think wanna be asking. I mean and so it might be the, you know, the place to start is, okay, illustrative math. Because we know that there are some levers there. It can open source. There are very different versions it. Some of them are digital, some of them aren't. Maybe that's a place to start, like teachers of illustrative math. And middle and like, what are they like? What are they not like? What are they, you know, wish existed? Were they not I mean, are they totally happy with it? You know? And and also,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: like, the questions underneath the questions are what you're saying. Like, do they ever decide to do something different on a Friday?

Them: Yeah.

Me: Or is it always, you know, we just did 5\.2\. Now we're doing 5\.3\.

Them: That's kind of the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: it's kind of where where, StoryQ or all the AI content fit because all the math teachers that we work with

Me: Mhmm.

Them: they all teach some sort of curriculum, like,

Me: Right. And they're, like, eligible one teachers or something. Right?

Them: or other things. And and then if they don't participate in research, they they they they probably have all sorts of excuse. They, oh, our curriculum is too crowded. But if they do decide to participate, that means they have some sort of flexibility.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: To squeezing additional content. And and then it could be remedial material or some other additional practice. It could be our our, you know, enrichment AI topics. That work with their algebra one content.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right? So that's the only model that I think I can think about. The other model would be decimal Decimal is occupying the know, algebra one zero two learning tool site in in terms of graphing. And and then as I think Coda does have a

Me: Mhmm.

Them: a pretty ready market there. There's a lot of schools are embracing data science or the data reasoning.

Me: Right. Right.

Them: Track as as a alternative strength. Right? So

Me: Yeah. So so in cases I mean,

Them: it could

Me: Desmond and CodeApp is an interesting layer. I'll get back to your teachers in a second. But you know, Desmos was replacing a thing that already existed but was, you know, inferior some way. Everyone was already using calculators and graphing calculators already, but they didn't there were aspects they didn't like about them that Desmos, you know, got in some way. Kodap a different animal to some degree. I mean, yes, it's math. But, you know, like, you do data. If you get to probability and statistics, it's June because it's the last chapter in the book. So there are some areas where teachers get it and it's more like the story cue And then there are other areas where you know, it might fit, but is it worth the the time investment? And then there are those new tracks, like data reasoning is opening up new swathes of territory. That's entirely true. But the interesting and interesting question among all these think you were hitting on it when you said, you know, research teachers, normally, like, well, yeah, but there's only so much we can learn because they've already self selected. But you're right. They self selected and that tells us that there are some teachers who have the time and space to do something different in math.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: So, like, even just why? Like, even going to the story key teachers and saying, like, why did you why were you able to sign up? What choices can you make in the curriculum? Why was this an interesting choice? Like, how does this fit? Like even what's the segment of teachers that can choose something different for two weeks? And, you know, where do we find them? That alone is an interesting set of questions. Right? Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. Our current participating teachers they were recruited at the school level. So the

Me: Okay. That's fine.

Them: recruited by the original education, computing education center.

Me: Mhmm. But there but there's still math teachers with two weeks to spare.

Them: It's it's very kinda yeah. Yeah.

Me: Like, I mean, I think you're you're hitting on that. Like, like, that would be a valid question to begin with. Are there math teachers with two weeks to spare or not? I mean, your answer is there are some. Like, what what makes them different and why? Right?

Them: Yeah. There there are definitely yeah. I think you have to look at

Me: Mhmm.

Them: really where all the kids they are probably, have already learned all the math outside of school when they come to to their

Me: Mhmm.

Them: math class.

Me: I mean,

Them: And their their their students their teachers are really looking at, you know, looking for more enrichment more challenge stuff for their kids.

Me: I mean, so and this is where sort of lateral thinking comes play too. I mean, yes, Yes. And maybe. So, yes, definitely, the places where people have leg room and the rich schools into something. And by the way, that's a real category, so don't ignore it. Like, there could be a lot. There are a of schools that have money and resources and might be interested in story and maybe that's a place to to roll forward. You know, when you start to think crazy, you know, like the reason that the other ones don't have two weeks to spare is that they actually are spending six weeks on remedial math. That's most of the schools and most of the places and most of the somethings. Maybe that's a reason to tilt away and just go to the rich schools. I don't know. Maybe it's a reason to tilt it. Like, if you could do somehow do story queue for remedial math, like, you would have a market bigger than you can imagine. Like, I know.

Them: I wouldn't help them to

Me: But, like, you're like, where are the things that what are the problems people are trying to solve in that? Well, I don't know. But, mean, math, the the problem people are trying to solve is remedial math. Like, you know, I don't know. Is there some way that you could tilt that and remedial math actually could serve a second purpose too would be that answer might very well be no. But, like, if you can engage students in remedial math,

Them: Yeah.

Me: in a way that was wholesome, then, like, you'd have something on your hands. I'm not proposing that we're doing that. I'm not saying we will. But, like, those are some of the kinds of questions. Like, when you ask people, you might find that the answer is in 90% of the cases, it's because remedial math. And either that means you set it aside and forget doing anything with math or it means you double down, or or you find the the ones who say, yes. I could do differently. Or you scratch your head about remedial math for a minute. You know, maybe there's some innovative thing that we could spend, you know, get $3,000,000 from NSF for that would flip it on flip it on its head. We're not the only ones to think about this. I'm sure that, you know, probably it's harder than that I'm saying in answer is probably no. But, like, those are the kinds of things. Like, you basically I wanna solve the problem of my kids don't have enough have this skills they need. Alright. Is there something to be done with that or or not? If not,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: find a different segment, different opportunity. Right? I mean, that's part of the deal too. I was just talking with somebody who was you know, really good thinker on this Berkeley professor who's helped us in the post project. Who said, At Berkeley, this is not just education research, things like projects and endeavors in general. Like, they sunset every ten years thing. Not because it just is a policy, not because it's bad, necessarily, because the thing probably is still useful, but things have a life cycle, he said, and they get to there. So sometimes you find a new thing and move on. So there may be cases where we're like, okay, that's that's not the thing, it's this new thing. Even if it was valuable, you can only get so much blood out of a stone. Don't know. But don't know what that means. Just know that in any of these cases, you get more insight by asking some of the interesting questions. And one interesting might be finding out why your teachers had two weeks to spare. And are there more teachers like those? And if they have two weeks to spare, why did they choose to do this? Like, why is two weeks plus AI combination that means something for them? Because I'm sure that of the subset of math teachers with Duke's despair, a lot of them would be interested in AI.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Think you're right.

Them: I I do think there's a market in the mass curriculum. For this kind of emerging topic.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Not for the reason that we think

Me: Mhmm.

Them: is as important, but more of, you know, mass is a

Me: Right.

Them: boring. In general, have sprinkle something more

Me: Right. It will be the chocolate for your

Them: outside of the normal routine is a good idea.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So they they they they often have a lot of teacher told me that they have to have Monday, this or or Friday this, you know, different kind of scene.

Me: Uh\-huh. It's

Them: Gives students something to look forward to.

Me: dessert. Yeah. Yeah. Well and and maybe that's a fact of life, and and we look for that. And and you know, for what it's worth, like, that's another different example of this something. Okay.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Is it like, if that's a pattern,

Them: Yeah.

Me: maybe it is, maybe it's not, you know, are there you make the story queue Friday module set? You know, where you story queue across

Them: Yeah. We can we can take

Me: thirty weeks.

Them: a data science Friday plus AM Monday.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah. I mean,

Them: Two sequels.

Me: those are the kinds of things. I mean, that's that's what you listen for as much as anything. It's like, like because they're saying they're saying my kids aren't engaged. You know? Okay. Fine. I can't get to the kids, but I can find the lever that you're choosing. Right? You're gonna buy dessert. You're, you know, a parent, you're gonna choose Fridays as something different. If I can make your Fridays wholesome, then, you know, I am serving the same thing as giving you a fiber rich dessert that your kids love at the same time. Like, I wanna be a good parent. I want my kids to be happy. I wanna be a good teacher. My kids to be engaged. Right? What's that? Mhmm.

Them: You know what? This might be a good idea. To make a it make it into a series of kinda Friday or Monday special, especially these two days are tough. Right?

Me: No. Mhmm. Right.

Them: Because the beginning of the week or the end of the week, that's people kids don't have any focus to do anything, like,

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: main content. And also anything before and after, break time, like, before and after holiday, those are also the

Me: Mhmm. That's true.

Them: tough time to grab any attention.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: We can we can make, those offerings and and make them coming keep coming.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. No. That's a really interesting question. I think it's well worth asking teachers about, and it might be that you know, there's an AI sandwich or something, and you've got a couple problems to sprinkle during the week or something like that. And if they find, you know, if kids are are engaged with them, they're asking to do it, you know, on a Wednesday afternoon, then you know, that's when the teachers start to lean into it. Like, oh, okay. Kids are really interested in this something, and they're learning math. So, hey, everybody wins. Right? Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Yeah. Maybe there will be I'm thinking about

Me: That's fine. Yeah.

Them: But it the question is if we're gonna to package this for sale, what does it look like?

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: Could it be some sort of I don't know, membership?

Me: Could be.

Them: Your membership? Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. I mean or it could be

Them: Once they they register as a member, they can they can just have access to the content.

Me: Mhmm. Right. So, I mean, you start to think about models then too, like, models of know, of of business. Right? I mean, there are some series come out every, you know, every week Some of them come out as a binge something. Is this a know, you subscribe and you get a new one every Friday. Is there some model where you can you know, you get the extra extra lessons in the middle or what have you? Or is this a thing that, you know, would again, with the piece, we'd we'd find somebody who wants augmentation of their curriculum in some way, and we package it together with theirs so that we get on the ship that they're already sailing of people and curriculum. But you know, add the and bring this AI Friday model to them.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. Interesting. Alright. Well, you I'll let you I'll let you keep on thinking about Fridays

Them: Okay. Good. It's something

Me: and and we'll go from there. And we'll we'll talk about proposals soon as well because those are very, very real and nice them in in all ways, shapes and forms.

Them: Oh, yes. Yes.

Me: I know. Alright. More more to come on that.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Bye.

Them: Bye.
