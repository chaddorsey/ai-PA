Transcript:

Me: Good morning.

Them: Good morning. Sue, you're here and not in your basement.

Me: It's for monitoring for

Them: That's the

Me: smile, for facial

Them: this is a big Sue. The real Sue's crying in her basement.

Me: I wanna say, yes. We're monitoring for affect here to see.

Them: Sorry. Understand this reference.

Me: What the result is.

Them: I I had a I had someone come and look at my basement, So more and more damp this and water in it. By someone who is either a really good salesman or and or knew what he was talking about and or whatever. But it just so I'm hiding it Concord. I think I might live here.

Me: Okay.

Them: No one

Me: You go. We don't have any water in the basement to Concord at all.

Them: Just a nice.

Me: Dan's not there today. Is he, Sue?

Them: No. Just me.

Me: Oh, He was at he was at home yesterday, looks like, when I talked with him. So Mhmm.

Them: E m he brought a whole bunch of pens back They're I'm gonna put them in the,

Me: Ah excellent!

Them: middle office where the Ed Concords are and things like that.

Me: K. I think for all of our actual manual writing needs. Because he was part of the tristate thing. So I don't want start that without him. Him.

Them: Oh, we could do a See's Candy fundraiser for now. I was like I was like, school. Right? Like Yeah. You could do wrapping paper. You know? I am not selling you wrapping paper.

Me: Oh my god.

Them: Well, well, I can talk about that. Come on, Leslie. Take one for the team. Oh god. I always was like, can I just give you cash

Me: Mhmm.

Them: for the school, please? I always did that. Buy this crap.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: I I agree.

Me: Oh, there he is. Oh, you are there. Sue didn't think you were there.

Them: Oh my god. Dan, you're here. I'm here for the strategy meeting. And no one's here. I'm here.

Me: We all heard you were coming, and so we ran away. So

Them: You you got the whole office dark. I didn't think you were here. Boy, where are you? I'm I'm in my room. Well, come on back. Okay. I'm coming back.

Me: Alright.

Them: Oh, hold, please.

Me: Represent. Very good. Very nice. How's your last week of summer, Jie, or weeks, week and a half? Is it When do you guys start

Them: Trying to survive. I used to have a good spot in Newton free library,

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: but now they're paving roads around the whole library, so no one can So I'm sitting in my car again. Very sad.

Me: Oh, no. What's when does school start for you guys?

Them: September September.

Me: Oh, okay. So you still have

Them: Yeah.

Me: a little bit of summer. Mhmm. Alright.

Them: Yes. Clara, you are right. We're that. Simple.

Me: Woo hoo. Alright. Here. Let's see. I thank you again for diving in with a meeting whiplash. I I've had kids and schedules and things that made me cancel a couple weeks, and I realized I canceled this one and rescheduled. But I wanted to make sure that we could connect at least to understand about the foray number one into Rhode Island and to think about what that means. And also because we haven't seen one of them for a couple weeks. We'll go around the agenda linearly. But we will dwell more on some than others. The only update we have written here, but there might be others is a reminder or notice about Danielle's onboarding she is on board and excited to be onboarding. She is virtually coming to the board meeting that we have on Friday for fifteen, twenty minutes, but just with our background, I said, I'm not even gonna meet with you. So you have pause deniability about any and everything to do with Concord. Just to wave to the board and say hello and talk about your, you know, your background. Then September 2, is her first day, which is Tuesday, the day after Labor Day. She's onboarding with Judy and paperwork, but it's a Tuesday and a chance connect with her in general, and people are often in the office. So I'd think this is notice number one. We'll I'll check schedules after this. We'll plan to have in person meeting that day and hopefully a lunch as well. And think we'll have some individual meetings with her but not overwhelm her that day. But that sort of weeks one and two is a placeholder for one of the things that we want Danielle to be able to do is to get connected in with PIs and others in the organization just to learn about the things that you do and your projects and your dreams and aspirations and what have you, and to start that process going. So I think that's a heads up for what we're gonna be scheduling some PI, you meetings individually with Danielle. Over the first couple weeks. But open to, you know, others' suggestions and and needs.

Them: What's the

Me: What am I missing about Danielle's onboarding, or what questions are there?

Them: what's the overlap with Rick? Is he still

Me: So Rick is staying on in a consulting sort of a reduced consulting capacity for the next we're taking a month by month, we're planning probably for the next few months into but to the end of the year. We'll do work with Danielle to make sure that it's not, you know, feeling like he's sort of she's got two people who are driving this all, but he is a resource We've been rolling out all of this sort of lead up with him, at the helm. So didn't wanna cut that off at the knees. And, you know, his he's not soaking us, by any means. Really, the contrary. I mean, his his charging is more than it's unreasonable on his end. He should be charging three times what he is. So, financially, it's not a problem. And he we have been meeting with him. We're meeting with him again tomorrow to think about the sort of transition piece. Maybe there are updates on that in general. Sue or what am I not saying about any of the rest of the kind of transition over to Danielle and discussion with Rick that I should be?

Them: No.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Nothing from my end other than just he is gonna be a resource to her. We're gonna make that clear to her in her onboarding plan. You know? And there there will be a within the first day or two, there'll be a meeting with Chad, Sue, and Rick to kind of give Daniel a lay of the land of, like, here's where we are. Here's what we've done. With Rick as a resource. Here's what we see. You know, Rick's involvement as, like, not you know, you shouldn't take direction from him. He's just here to help you kind of guide you into this position that at a company that has never had one before, essentially. And so, yeah, I think Rick Rick is has come up with kind of a set of deliverables for Danielle. And he's, you know, offered to kind of work with Chad and Sue on holding her accountable. For those as well for the first, like, three, six, twelve months. So he's kind of working more so with us on documenting that and and laying it out. For her. Is there is there a direction that Rick and y'all have come up with to help her at least get like,

Me: Yep.

Them: first step forward as opposed to here's everything. What do you think? You know? Like, that's

Me: Yeah. Yeah. We're setting goals on we're we're

Them: Yeah. There's, like,

Me: you know trying to lay out goals for numbers of inquiries and and targets for foundations, that's we think that's the first, you know, few months. We think turning to corporate sponsorships, you know, after that. Because the foundation round really happens in those first three months of her time. Makes sense. And then, you know, beyond that, we're sort of laying out the other kinds of goals there. So we've got at least a first set of targets and goals for her to work with, including a set of 60 paired down to 10 to 15 foundations that we think are really prime targets. So she's not yeah. I mean, Rick was like, yeah. If I were he started in various positions and sometimes you could help. Sometimes they're like, hey. What do you wanna do? And

Them: Right.

Me: you're like, I have no idea who you are or what should we so trying to not, you know, impose on her, but give her a you know, as much sort of groundwork as we can. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I think within that list of deliverables you know, for Danielle. Like, there's a, you know, week one, here's what we should be keeping her up to date on or getting her on task with and then three you know, like I said, there's, like it's, like, a month to month list as well as the email campaigns, right, the targeted email campaigns and getting her set up with Mailchimp and working with Cynthia on the various types of, like, communications that can go out, and she'll have her own set of communications that she'll be sending out. On that as well. So

Me: That

Them: Dan. Should we expect as part of onboarding that she's gonna meet with

Me: Yeah.

Them: each of the PIs,

Me: We were just saying that at the beginning that we'll we'll set up meetings on the first couple of weeks. With individual with individual PIs so that you get a chance to connect with her and tell tell her about your, you know, work, etcetera. And Sue,

Them: Yeah. It to follow on to that, there there actually is a folder in our strategic development shared drive that says Danielle onboarding. It's super drafty, You don't need to add anything to it. We'll have it you know, we'll be meeting next Monday, a smaller group to try to finalize it so we can just hand it to her. But if you take a look through there and see anything that you think should be added or something, just Slack us and let us know, and we'll Where is this? In the well, you know, the Concord strategic shared drive we have? Maybe.

Me: Now you do

Them: Yeah. We all are have a shared drive.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Called start Concord strategic development, and then they're there. So there's a folder that says Daniel onboarding. I love it. Yeah.

Me: K.

Them: So she will work on the foundation corporate sponsorship will she write those proposals? Or we're still the one that

Me: She'll take the lead on things

Them: write the proposals?

Me: are private funding, which is to say, you know, both I think, managing, understanding the portfolio of places that we might be to with which opportunities and the ways to engage with them. Some need letters of intent, and some have

Them: Mhmm.

Me: specific call for funding. Some we have relationships that are existing with, etcetera. That said, she's not gonna, like, just look at the website for StoryQ and tell you that she submitted three proposals to the foundations last week. Mean, obviously, she's gonna work closely with folks to to get the essence of what makes sense and to identify opportunities. But she's also not gonna say, oh, I found this foundation. Can you, you know, submit to them and tell me how it went? You know, she's so there's private funding, she's the the point person on it, but we'd expect that she'll pull people in for both sort of content and, you know, meetings across spectrum is appropriate. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. So so I'm I'm mostly concerned whether these the opportunities, writing proposals for them will will collide with our other proposal writing activity. If she is doing the writing mostly, that's less concerning on my side. Yeah. Is a big part of her job. Right? And she was asked you know, every candidate was asked to send writing samples. When they applied and were selected for interviews. Not it's not I I think it'll be a collaborative nature, but that's collaborative than you might be imagining. Right? She might need it's with you if there's a particular AI focus. Right? You know, she would like to get your insight. But primarily, I believe she'll be the lead author of these things.

Me: Yeah. And, I mean, some of that will evolve, but I think I think the other the question on the the complementary side is equally valid. We've been discussing this, and we've this will, you know, won't be a week one thing. But the, you know, making sure that as we are writing, you know, big NSF proposals, that she is in the loop and helping us understand that those might involve, you know,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: might be hiding opportunities inside them or what have you. So we were, you balling the other day saying, well, maybe there's a process, you know, after we submit a proposal that we sit down with Danielle and debrief it the week and explain it to her and the partners because

Them: Mhmm.

Me: know, she might be like, oh, so you're working with Oklahoma. I just a person in Oklahoma with something. Can we talk to that school district and connect them over to something? Or it's like there are actually three different little mini projects in there that we could propose to know, foundation x and y and z. So, hopefully, we can, you know, be synergistic about it. While not disrupting the NSF proposal process at the same time. Mhmm.

Them: I also have some questions about how the budgeting and staffing process will look, but we we can we can talk about that later in another meeting.

Me: Okay. That's fine. Other questions about that onboarding for Daniel? I mean, we're we're excited. She's excited. She's very enthusiastic all the way through. As those of you who have talked to her know, I think that that's genuine, and hopeful that this will be, you know, positive overall. And I'm sure we'll learn a lot as we go to I mean, there's so many unknowns about how we fold this into our process and saying x and y and z definitively, and maybe that you know, two of those change right away because she has a different assumption. But it's more capacity than we've had, and she's got great experience.

Them: One just one question.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Is she nearby the office?

Me: Yeah. She is in Westford, I think. Guard. Park. Yeah. Harvard. So

Them: Oh, Harvard. Right near me? Excellence.

Me: you go. So you guys can pack together. We haven't set expectations for her about in off out of office. We have said that we, you know, gather you know, quasi regularly these days and probably will a little bit more once we you know, become a more you conservatively smaller organization in a few weeks. But we haven't said you need to be in the office three a week or put her name on a door or anything, but we're open either way. We certainly have doors that could have names on them that's useful for her.

Them: Should know to check\-in with me or Sue if she wants to come in.

Me: Exactly. Yes. And to check out where you're hiding in the backroom before she

Them: Yeah. Right. No hiding in the back.

Me: soon as the note is there, Alright. So let's transition to the thing that we're talking about so we don't forget about it because it's been, a couple weeks, and I wanna hear about it. It's my as anybody. So the first piece on Tri State is just, you know, what what what do you guys do? What do you guys learn? What are what what are the takeaways? You know, tell us everything we need to know. Mhmm. You had one session with seven?

Them: Dan, do you wanna go first, or do you want me to go first?

Me: Teachers?

Them: It doesn't matter. We had I mean, I I'll start, and you can jump in. I'm not I won't try and cover everything. Yeah. It was we were able to work with the conference organizer. So it was kind of even advertised through them. And, we were able to set up a pre conference eight in the morning, which is not that early for teachers.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Focus group. And I think I almost know, like, 10 out of 12, I think, showed up. For it. So that was good. I do feel like we learned some stuff, but I also feel like it was a litany a little video syncretic based on, like, the first person who starts talking and gets everybody, like, oriented and in a particular direction. So you know, I I do think it was helpful, but I feel like it'd be hard to generalize broadly from what we learned in this particular thing. Leslie led it, and I mostly took notes. So those notes there are primarily me sort of trying to capture things in real time. Then there's a Granola summary below that with the big bold tri state alliance focus. Group thing. One of the things that was kind of interesting is well, and was surprising to me. One was that several people talked about wanting to get kids outside and doing stuff, and that that was a struggle for them. That that kids are just not really outdoor oriented anymore. It's like, I'm on my phone. Or I'm, you know, willing to sit in class. If we go outside, there's, like, bugs and Okay. You know, opportunities to misbehave.

Me: So the the struggle wasn't logistically getting a class outdoors. It was

Them: So much that it was more behavioral and, like, getting students to just deal with being outside. Now most of them said if they did it regularly, they could get it down and but it was just surprising to me I feel like, oh, hands on, doing outside, like, kids must really wanna do that. We need to build more of that in. They were discouraging that, but that was a little bit surprising to me. Yeah. And and to to follow on with that thought, I was also interested in the fact that there are a number of curricular people, project, promoting people out there, several of whom were at this conference who are making outdoor curriculum. Right? Like, it it looks and smells like a Carol and Stout gig. Right? Yep. Yeah. There were actually a couple of people were working with the Harvard like, LTER group. The Harvard Forest, does some curriculum that that they put out there for people to use. It's about observing trees and and such. So they weren't actually going to the Harvard Forest. But they were they were doing the, they were doing some curriculum developed them, which is interesting because we talked to the Harvard Forest people years ago about getting Kodap as part of their stuff and whatnot. But we didn't really follow through strongly with that. I think another insight that was interesting is OpenCyad continues to sort of wiggle its way into everywhere. Teachers generally don't love it. It's it's it's at some level, we would probably love it if we were to just read it because it's just like the things that we've developed for a very long time where we spent six weeks on, like, evaporative cooling. And, and they do that kind of thing where it's like okay. We really need to get students deep into something. And build on all kinds of scientific and engineering practices and you build it up over time, and you stay in context, and you go deep. And and both the teachers and the students say they get really bored with looking at the same phenomenon for weeks. And you know, that's very similar to at least stuff I'll say I have developed in the past where where, you know, we add hand hands on thing and a simulation, and we do an iteration on our model. We do this and that and then we stand the same for weeks. It's like what Open SIAD is doing. And and no one likes it. The the other thing that is going on is at least at the elementary level, Amplify is being used a lot there, I think. And a lot for doing literacy as well. It's kind of squeezing out science time. So they spend a lot of time doing Amplify in some places, We had this one teacher who was, like, really into technology, stuff and doing labs, but they had to share all the lab equipment. And, again, there's no storage in their schools, so they stored it, like, behind the stage or something. It just was such a pain to do anything hands on that she would mostly do worksheets at. You know, occasional computer stuff. I thought that was kind of idiosyncratic. You know, problem for her particular school, though. Yeah. And a and a few more words about Open SciEd. In general. Right? Like, it's not just it's out there. And they're not thrilled with it, but they are being mandated to use it Right? It's not like this is a choice that they have. They're their districts or their schools have adopted it. And so they are faced with like, this problem because they have this curriculum that is one of the teachers there called it overpaced. Yep. Right. If you taught every last little bit of it, it would be a hundred and seventy days which is just too many, to to have official programming. And it offered very few opportunities for customization. Right? One one teacher probably the same one who called it over paced had actually rewritten the module because she wanted it to to be about the Long Island sound, which was their community rather than, you know, whatever Colorado or whatever wherever the environmental unit was was based on. Which is a huge amount of work, and most teachers don't have that kind of time. They also are faced with the problems, you know, the standard stuff. Right? Literacy is king, and kids are doing badly at it. Some years, there are state tests that focus on history, not science, So they're you know, they gotta emphasize that. Right? And And there's nobody helping them to do the thing they really need to which is to figure out how to integrate this very packed, complicated curriculum into these other subjects that, at least as far as their school standards are concerned, they really must be focusing on. Right? They have no help to do that. They have no help to make it more interactive. If you can believe this, I it's boggling to me. But but Open Sci Ed is perceived as a noninteractive curriculum. Well, they originally designed it. They wanted not to use any kind of digital resources because they wanted it to be, like, distributable via PDF. It was originally designed as a pretty I mean, it was there was supposed to be lots of lab and that kind of stuff in there, but you know, they're they're trying to balance, like, universally available and doable without lots of additional resources. And still kind of inquiry oriented or whatnot. And I've heard it's interesting because some teachers have yet the inquiry bent, and some people thought I'm just supposed to if I just did it, like, they it to me. I'm I'm lecturing at my students all day. Which is weird because I know the open sci ed group would never think that's how it's supposed to be implemented. But that's how some teachers are interpreting it. And they do wanna and, I mean, one of the things is teachers do want to to have ways of doing inquiry, of doing hands on stuff with students. But they really do wanna do that. And they're trying to figure out how to do it. In the framework of the open sided curriculum or outside of it. That's what they need to do. I did have one one thing which a a teacher mentioned that I thought was interesting and potentially promising. Let me see if I could find the the particular thing they were referring referring to. But, basically, they said they had access to an AI like, lesson generator thing. And that they said in order to to which they felt less capable of designing their own inquiry oriented activity. They went to the AI thing and said, this is what I wanna teach. And how do I how do I create an an inquiry oriented lesson around this? And it built up a whole thing. And I said, I need some differentiation, and they gave them that. And, like, Wow. That was kind of amazing.

Me: Brisk teaching is it's highlighted right now from somebody.

Them: Right. So is it called? Brisk. Yeah. Okay. There it Yeah. My notes

Me: Risk teaching. Yeah. It is.

Them: Brisk. I don't know if that's the right word. Brisk. Oh, it is. Yeah. Was trying to capture it and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: as we're there was I was typing furiously during this most of this thing. So I thought that was really interesting. That they were you know, so first, like, really promising use. I've heard a teacher you know, take AI to do something creative and interesting with their classes. I don't know. But so that was that was interesting. Another thing that I think relates to us is, you know, people love FET, and they love that lots of teachers have put up lessons around that. We have our own tons of very well used simulations, We should be figuring out how to how to how to draw upon those a lot more than we currently do. We need a dedicated database of those things. We need ways for people to contribute lessons around that stuff. You know, it it I was kind of I was blown away when we went to Google Analytics to look at you know, how many people used, how many people want, how many simulations were launched by different people last year? And it was like, 850,000\. I mean, really, high. We're it's up near, like, how many times people hodge code app. It's how many times people watch a simulation that from lab dot Concord. These are the ones also built into our materials. But so we don't know if it's an individual launch or it's part of a a thing. But it's the the way Google Analytics counts in unique users is, you know, if I open up, you know, three or four of them, it's not gonna count to three or four times. So we're talking about 850,000\. Yeah. Unique users opening lab stuff. And we are the fact that everyone knows fat and almost nobody knows Concord stuff really drives me up the wall, simulation plan. I find it interesting. Mean and, you know, the question about how in the idiosyncratic, you know, that, you know, open Syed is is infiltrating everywhere, and yet these big wonkin, you know, curriculum modules are know, which often when people talk about, like, can you fill up the entire year with your stuff? You know? Like, is that always the best answer? Because teachers like to make things their own. Right? So it's an interesting dilemma about how to complement or how to to market our stuff where it's not we're not trying to over take your entire your curriculum, but we've got stuff that was really adaptable and usable and you know, it's one week or, you know, one day or whatever. You know? I I think I've always wondered about you know? Because I came from EDC where we did entire year modules, you know, biology curriculum for the entire year, and it's it's like yeah. And how do people actually implement is not exactly the word for word, like, here's my our teacher guide was double the length of the student guide trying to help teacher and that doesn't always work. Right? So you know, seeing all of these teachers kinda go, yes. We have to use OpenSyed, and here's the pain points with that. It is is fascinating to me. I mean, yes, this is one group, and and I don't wanna say this is true of everybody. You know? But it's an interesting question for us. Yeah. I think and what I think someone said the OpenCyenne teacher guide was 480 pages or something like that. And I was like, oh,

Me: Hi.

Them: that's huge. Mine are only, like, 60 to 80 pages. How about one paragraph that's

Me: Right.

Them: probably as much attention and and time as you But when you build it when you kinda build it in, to the I think with our teacher, mode in the activities, I think it spreads it out and chunks in a way that that isn't overwhelming. Right. But but I I do think that for teachers, it seems like well, so it's interesting. OpenSign is being adopted in lots of places. Why? It's a full curriculum. It is the whole year curriculum. And so someone can say, we're gonna adopt this curriculum. If we have a single simulation or a one day thing, that can be you know, you can make your own modifications and do stuff around and figure out how to put it into your stuff. If you have your six week unit on evaporative cooling, which I love, by the way, And, you know, I would probably do it if I were teaching. But most teachers are gonna be like, I can't spend that much time on that one thing even though they're actually doing all kinds of different things during that that long unit. And so it seems like teachers like most teachers, like to have smaller chunk things that they can drop in or adapt or wrap around their own stuff. People who decide on what curriculum gets adopted like to have whole year curriculum things. That they can look at and give their teachers, like, here's a book or here's OpenCYN. Or here's interactions curriculum. I mean, the the reason that got adopted somewhat more broadly than some of our other things is because it turned into a whole year thing. And so LAUSA said, yes. We wanna do that. Or Detroit said, yes. We can do that. And, again, it's not the teachers. It notice I'm I'm talking big district. Because someone else other than the teachers makes the decision on how that gets adopted. And I think open side is probably a similar kind of thing. You know? I I I would say out of, like, 10 teachers that I talked to about open side, one really loved it. And nine of them hated it.

Me: And so that was part of my question. So would you say I mean, that these comments are distilling, you know, that they hated it or that they had quibbles with it but got that it was trying to do something good or that it was something like, what's the what's the the pain point of the opportunity, and and what what are the what's the real feeling it? Maybe that's a question we need to know more about. But

Them: If if you give them the the I love it or I hate it, I hate it. But if you try and dive a little bit deeper, they'll say, well, there are parts I really like certain things, but it's overpay. And I can't spend this long in the phenomena. Like, kids really like it, but then they get bored with the that same phenomena coming back to it over and over again. So I you know, it's it's really a mixture I do think that you know, I know the folks who wrote Open Scikit, and they're coming at it from a similar perspective of, like, let's dive really deep. Let's get into science and engineering practice Let's come at it from lots of different angles so that we can bring in all kinds of stuff. And that's that's what I've done for many years. And so I get it. I get the urge to do that. But, it it just people feel even if you're you're you know, just it's just because it's, the same phenomenon. Even though you're doing different things and learning different practices, and coming at it and thinking about it in different ways, They just wanna be able to say I've covered more types of more phenomena. Like, now we're not doing evaporative cooling. Now we're gonna do boiling point. Whatever it is, if you're in chemistry class, they could be related things that you you can't just stick on the same thing for for weeks. Because it just at least people don't like it. Right. I mean, this is the outcome of both project based learning and ambitious science teaching, which is you have this phenomenon and you you know, how how do you build and build and build and build and build, right, so that the creating knowledge, whatever. But it often goes beyond, a, the attention span of the students and, b, the attention span of the teachers. You know? And clearly clearly, I think, you know, this has always been an interesting, you know, dilemma of of, you know, the the duration how much you can fit in. And then tangentially connect because it's related, but we're ticking off these these NGSS standards You know? And then, oh, yes. It's all related to, you know, the the the the same topic. Is it? Or, you know, that kind of thing. And so it it is it is a challenge. And, you know, this I mean, seriously, thirty year forty years ago, when I was doing it, this is exactly what insights and biology was. You know, categorically, and and it had to be changed because the teacher guys were horrible, and the teachers were not using it the way that it was implemented. Like, I you know, I came to to cc saying, don't do a 100 pages of teacher guide. No teacher's gonna read it, period. Like, this is our experience, and so it hasn't changed. Nobody we always do the same mistakes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And and and there's more. Right? Like and and you are fighting with every other part of the curriculum. Right? Like, it's not enough just to make it bite size. It also has to have a clear pathway to embed it inside a history curriculum or a, you know, or an English curriculum. Right? Like, the the the the ELA module that Jay and Rebecca made, is brilliant. It's long. I don't know if that's a barrier. But like, that's the kind of thing. Even if we don't change a thing about what we're doing, just like you know, put together a one page teacher thing that says, here's how this integrates with other subjects. Right? Know, learn about landmass and then also learn about, you know, war wars and wars and country barriers and how they were impacted by the land mass. Right? That kind of thing. It I think I didn't wanna cut you off. No. No. You you're good. Go. I was gonna say, I think the thing that's hard is teachers are looking for ways to, like, how do I do modeling? How do I do so there's a new thing. And just giving them the activity in a paragraph is not enough. We've been able to do it well with teachers who are part of a research thing where we can do do professional development for a summer institute and then have, like, a you know, a weekly check\-in or, you know, every other week check\-in with teachers in the evening or something like that. That kind it needs all of that work. So what we end up doing is it's like, well, but I'm gonna put this out after the project is over. So I need to build in all this, you know, teacher educative material into my teacher guide, and that's what makes them so long. Is because we're trying to not do we're trying to make them self contained professional learning required. And one of the things about Open Sci Ed which is interesting, even though have their 480 page teacher guide. There's a ton of people who are making a business out of doing professional learning on how to OpenSyre. Partly because nobody reads the 4,480 page teacher guide. Probably, if they read it, they wouldn't need the professional learning. Right? So they're doing again, the open side people are doing what we've done forever. We try and build in all of the stuff that we wanna help them figure out how to do new from a pedagogical perspective. Into our t guide materials. And it's too much. It can't be related well relayed well through reading It's better done through professional learning institutes and things like that. If one of the ways teachers are going to think about teaching going forward or creating lessons going forward is through these AI generators. Is there is there a way for Concord to, like, get its models in these AI generator first? Well, yeah, I think that I mean, one of the things so one of the things I was talking about for so we're working on a resource database for Kodap. Mhmm. One of the kinds of resources will be a dataset. And I would I would say, you know, we should look at, like, having a button that's, like, make a lesson around this dataset. It it asks you certain criteria, like, what grade level and what kinds of standards do you wanna get at and blah blah blah. And then it would create the lesson for you and not just give you the dataset. You the dataset in a lesson. I could imagine a similar kind thing if we had a model database or a simulation database. You can have a similar thing where you ask it to create a lesson for you, or we have people contributing lessons or we ask it to make three, and we post three exemplars and Mhmm. You know, or make your own.

Me: Amy,

Them: Mhmm. I'm just curious about sort of the for our agenda, how does this play out for moving forward?

Me: Right.

Them: Right? Like, now we've learned something, you know, but this is one And is it valuable to continue to do these?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: In or is there something we wanna do differently? Is it you know, like, right now, it's me and Dan debating what the best curriculum approach for the best simulations, and that's not what we're supposed to be doing. Right? Like,

Me: Well right. No. Actually actually, I mean, I think you had both I mean, yes and. I mean, I think to some degree, it is what was in other words, my first question would be, you know, did we get something new from this we didn't expect? And I feel like we've already answered that question. Like, we would never be having this conversation if it weren't for the fact that we saw teachers all nodding. And so, like, we wouldn't have thought that that was we'd known that they were all taking up open sided, that they were sort of feeling compelled, that they were and at least I feel like I have four or five new questions now to ask of certain groups of teachers about this to try to understand more. Which leads directly into your point, Amy. Like, okay. What do we what do we wanna ask now? You know? And how can we, you know, set up situations to to ask it? Jie, you had your hand up. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I sort of have start.

Me: Nope. We lost you for a second.

Them: What other

Me: Start start again.

Them: weather

Me: Mhmm.

Them: yeah, question. If we can eliminate from these, you know, things that we learned from the teachers and schools, whether we can eliminate some spaces that were not interested in getting into. So in the future, interactions with teachers and schools, we can getting more focused to stay. We do wanna do

Me: Mhmm.

Them: get into. Right? Like, the kids don't want it to go outdoor kind of thing. Right? Are you gonna do anything about it?

Me: And

Them: Start a sports activity?

Me: Yes. I mean, I feel like one of the things that you know and and maybe we're doing it implicitly, but maybe we can spend few minutes doing it explicitly. You know, it feels like there are sets of questions that are arising from this. That we should understand more about and, you know, implicitly or by asking those, we're not asking others. But that's good. That's part of the the narrowing process. So let's spend a minute on that. You know, what what do we feel like came out of this? What do we feel we want to know more about? Now based upon what we've learned in this and, you know, any of the analysis stuff that we've done And then

Them: I I do wanna point out one, idea that I heard several times is about generating lessons around our simulations or our around our tool. I think that's a very straightforward application of large one good model, but you also need to be aware that that kind of application or easily kinda once the big players are getting into that space, they can easily wash out all the little application. That we attempt to make, like OpenAI, Or MIT also came up with a a learn kinda portal thingy that you can just because they have tons of tons of courses already in their open learning space, and and then this generator can allow learners to find very precisely among all the thousands of courses which one you should be learning about. So so So, there's places that we probably should avoid just because big players may just stamp out all the little players. If they get into the space. The moat the moat is not wide on the search. Yeah.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right? But the moat is very wide on the companion simulation. Idea. We have a lot of sims that nobody else has. Whatever reason. They didn't have time. They didn't think it was important. They didn't you know, they haven't categorized them well enough to to be able to say whether they're relevant or not. Right? Fett Fett is pretty much the only player out there. Gizmos is coming up around the bend, but they're for pay. And, you know, and we need to talk about that too. But you know, Phet is pretty much the only one out there, and I think that a lot of us at Concord feel like the Fett Sims are kind of lame sometimes. You know? Or at least only physics focused.

Me: There's enough of a difference that there's an opportunity in, you know, space in our work as compared to the Fed. And I think that opportunity lies in the fact that we do more and apply them in more ways. So it might lend itself to what you're describing, Jie. I I agree. And if we can find that opportunity where the threat is not overwhelming it because, you know, it's yes. Other people are making these things, but they're not they don't have the the sauce that we do, then that's where really interesting things can come. Dan, you're

Them: And there's something so a couple things. One, there's something to be said about convenience. If I am searching Concord Sims, there was a button there to make you know, lesson thing, that doesn't matter if other people have lesson making things. Right? That still makes it even more attractive for me to come to Concord's database of stuff. The other thing in terms of the FET stuff, they have I mean, they have some really good simulations. I think the biggest difference between Fet and us for a long time is a lot of our sims are built on like, first principles. Like, we we put like, serious physics engines underneath, and we get all kinds of emergent properties. They kinda hard coded what the result is supposed to be for a lot of things. So some people like this idea of, like, really seeing what's the emergent property versus you know, I have fudged and made sure you're gonna get the answer that you get when you push this thing in in Feb. So I think that's some of the biggest difference between our stuff. So I in many ways, we're competitors, but there's a it's it's not a 100% overlap. There's there's a big chunk of stuff that we do uniquely. That they don't do, and I I think there's plenty of room for us to to, build on our Right. It just it behooves us to articulate what those differences are and make sure that other people understand them. Right? That's that's where the marketing part comes in.

Me: Right. And understand how they intersect with the value that people might perceive or the the issues that they're running into.

Them: Yeah. There's another piece here, though, that

Me: Jie?

Them: seems feels like an opportunity to me. Is that people need to take open SIED because they've been told they have to. And they need to find ways to widow it down. In in in ways that are safe Right? I heard a lot of folks both at this focus group and then, you know, talking to people at the booth and in the one session that I went to talking about the fact that you know, they they need to cut it down. They wanna cut it down, but they don't know how to do that. Safely. Right? Like, they don't know how to do that without leaving out the critical bits, and they don't have the time You know? Right? We've all written curriculum. Right? It's time consuming. It's taking months on a single unit to to figure out how to do it without losing any of, like, the critical points. Right? So if we could find some methodology or large language model application that would both understand the breadth of what's there, allow them to give some parameters about how they wanna shrink it down, and then spit out a usable version of that. Like, you know, with appropriate simulations sprinkled in because that's our secret sauce. You know? Like, that seems very, very valuable. That would be an incredibly valuable service. And, of course, it has to do all the other things, accessibility, LTI, blah, blah. There's you know, there's the price of admission, but, you know, but that's not a feature. That's just a thing you have to have.

Me: Yeah. I was wondering what you would have that, Jie.

Them: Jie? But just my gut feeling, maybe getting a little bit into the SWATS analysis side of the things. I feel like our team is really an innovative learning experience kind of genetic built inside our our our our company. And I think the space that we should really establish ourselves is that zero to one kinda space from nothing to existing? Like, we should really kinda doing what we have been doing, working with the scientists and the engineering, bring the very much frontier content into the classroom. No one else have those stuff. And we're not gonna compete with anybody on the on the market because we're doing the zero to one kind of business. And open side or whatever side out there, they will not have such content because we are the one that who actually work with scientists, STEM to bring those very fresh frontier materials into the past. And and teacher would know this. You know? He had been teaching ideal gas law or molecular interactions forever. Those are all written in the standard. Everybody teach that. But they need once they see something very fresh, very new, they knew what might excite their students, and they'll make the space in their in their curriculum. Because of the the the draw of the content itself.

Me: That sounds like a really great assumption test, right there. There are two or three useful assumptions to test in there. One of them is that last statement, like, I see something exciting. Will I I make space or or not? You know, I think in there, there are a couple others that we should tease out about what, you know, what a teacher's really what are they looking for and what are they weary of, you know, kind of thing or because I think there there's a space in there. And, you know, I'd I think I think you're definitely right that zero one is a space that we can, you know, grab onto that others can't. What we do with that, I think, is a little bit more of a more open question because we have lots of zero one stuff on our website that get used or we can't maintain or something. So there may be, you know, end teachers aren't teaching the zero to one because they have to teach the, you know, one to 10 that they're meant to aim for. So I think there are lots of really cool questions about where the the intersection between those might be that because if we can bring that zero to one with millions of dollars funding and fold it into something teachers are gonna use, wow, then then we're really going. Mhmm. Dan?

Them: One last piece of info that I wanna pull out from our notes on focus group is one teacher in particular. So I don't know how broadly this is, but he really likes Inkits. Right?

Me: Fascinating. That's that's one

Them: Genesis Genesis inkets piece where there's labs, virtual labs that are a lot of detailed analytics. He likes the dashboard he gets back to get a sense of what kinds of things students are doing when they're using the simulation. So it's not just the simulation is out there. They've done it. And then there's some written thing, but there's there's info on their interactions with the that he finds really useful. So you know, I know if that's a broad pattern that other people would find useful, but do know that dashboards are a huge thing for most commercial products. And you know, unfortunately, they're mostly about student answered these three multiple choice questions this way, and so we now check off that standard. We say the student's yellow on that standard or red or whatever. And so it's more complex when you're working with simulations but that's an area where definitely people are starting to get into, but we could we could start to think about because we have lots of simulations. What are the kinds of things that we would wanna report back on in terms of those? And and and Janice has gone from know, more hard coded programmatic stuff to being more AI interpretation oriented and and she's kinda kept up with that and there's a market for it. She she definitely I don't know how well is doing, but I don't think she's don't think she's at every like, tea or she or the Incot whatever is has a booth at, like, every education conference, and they're pretty well known. So she's built up a nice business on that.

Me: Yeah. It's kinda interesting. That's the first person person I've heard actually using it. I have seen them sub present. So, I feel like I'm hearing at least two categories of questions, and let me check that against others. I feel like there's one category of questions just around I wanna know more about Open SciEd and how people are or aren't using it and what they are or aren't, you know, liking hating, weary of, what have you. What are the what's what's that like for people? And, you know because I think there are opportunities within that. Like, if we can ride that train in some way, shape, or form, and make teachers' lives better with it, feels like there's something in there. I feel like we're also these are not these are overlapping, but I feel like we're also hearing a useful set of assumptions from our side about simulations being valuable for teachers. And I don't know that we know teacher besides them saying we're like fat that we know more about teacher's experience. What what are other people thinking about those two bubbles that you would raise? Would you raise other ones? Would you knock those down?

Them: I The second one okay. K. I agree with those. Those those both need asking and and picking apart. I I would want to know more about both how how do they need help contracting their materials and how do they need help expanding them? Right? To to Jay's point, are they willing to, and are they looking for opportunities to put in new materials and how do they make their choices about how to trim their materials in order to fit those opportunities? Right? What are they what are they doing? What do they wish they were doing? By the way, Carolina Biological was at this Tri State Alliance Conference. They had a booth and the main thing they were pushing at their booth was their version

Me: Mhmm.

Them: of OpenSyad. And if you look at the pay if you look at the web page about it, it says redesigned and reformatted print materials, easier to read and follow, simplified investigations, materials to reduce teacher prep and classroom time, digital resources to engage students, support teachers, report to administrators. Tested lessons and materials, ADA compliance,

Me: Yep.

Them: That's they're saying, we've taken open science since it's an open curriculum. We've made a we've adapted it in a way probably that they're trying to respond to what teachers are feeling about it and integrated their materials to it. Yeah. So there's already one example of a commercial entity that has done this with a OpenSaya. Right. And activate across the way was doing exactly the same thing.

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Well, that's their goal. Right? I mean,

Them: Exactly. They have good they have good marketing teams.

Me: Mhmm. When we talked to, you know, OpenSlide back at the beginning and said we need more computers, their response was what Dan said. We're working with states and the states said we can't too technology heavy, this is pre pandemic, but when we're done, you can make your own. Like, that's the point. We were sort of frustrated at that point, we knew that, yes, that was always option B was make your own whatever. Right? That's part of the goal of this open curriculum thing. So there's no question. And that make your own might be We've got alternate light versions of each of the units or we've got things that you can that replace pages 40 through 65 of, you know, unit two or something like that that make it shorter and also bring in some variation but are safe, you know, for the pedagogically safe kind of thing.

Them: And they also sell PD around their version of OpenSciOp. Or OpenSciet in general. They were listed on the OpenSciet side, Carolina is listed as a certified. Professional learning provider. Mhmm. For open sciad.

Me: So I'm gonna skip the process review piece I think we can talk about it with ease. We've got a couple more chances to be next to teachers and we should talk about how and if we can make those any or all those into things where we could to talk with teachers around this these kinds of questions. And some about the logistic because we need to have people there to be next to teachers. So I've got three. One is more parenthetical, Kentucky, but mass q and mast are two things that we either have or are in you know, very on the verge of signing up for officially. And signing up right now mostly means I'm looking at Kiley here. Mostly means booth, but also booth and. Right? I mean, we we sort of have sessions at these, but we're totally sure.

Them: So for mast, it's just a booth.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: MAST is Massachusetts Association of Science Teachers. It's I forget. Is it in Boxborough again, Dan? Marlborough. Marlborough. So it's a smaller conference. It's one day. The deadline to, like, give a presentation is since past, but we can still sign up to be an exhibitor at that conference. So again, a booth, a table. And this one, was talking to Chad yesterday, is probably very similar to the Tri State Alliance and that it would be very easy to get a focus group session again together, at that one. I think we Right. The same person one of the so since the Tri State Alliance was, like, the heads of all the thing, putting it together, they will know us. Person who is who is probably putting that together will know you know, me from the presentation and us me Leslie and I from asking about that. So we might be able to set up a focus group at that in a similar way. It'll probably be smaller or similar size to the tristate Alliance I've been to it before a few times. It's always in the same hotel for decades now.

Me: It's a it's a four ninety five one or yeah.

Them: Yeah. We're over four ninety five and twenty intersect. There's a

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just

Them: right off the exit, and it's right there. So

Me: should probably sign myself up for that one since it's, like, five miles away from me. But

Them: So here's here's my question about that and and any of these, really. The the thing that we went to was the first time that they had done it, the and and I could kinda tell that they were bootstrapping their way through how to organize a thing like this. So they did not actually build in more than I think, one half hour slice. In the day where people could go to booths. Which shame on them because they're charging people money for that. And, you know, Lego is not gonna show up next year because

Me: Right.

Them: they do We have a very little booth traffic, I would say. Yeah. At the tristor. You know, don't get me wrong. I was glad that I was there. But the focus group was the meat in that sandwich. And I don't know if it is possible, but if the schedule is the same and it's I I don't think it's that nobody wanted to talk to us. I think it's that they simply didn't have time to do so. If the schedule is also similarly not well laid out, it may or it may not be worth having a booth. Unless that is the price of admission that allows us to to Jimmy them into

Me: Yep.

Them: setting up the focus group for us.

Me: Right. Right.

Them: Right? Like, I feel like that's what we paid for. You know?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Whatever fees that we paid at at risk, I feel like we basically paid for them to help us set up the focus group, and maybe that was worth it. But that's a question, like, that we need to be asking. Right? If I go to a major conference, you know, ASWE or something, there are dedicated hour long slots and sometimes more every single day of the conference so that people have time to go through and, you know, do the booth thing. Not always even then is it all that successful, but you know, at least there's an opportunity. At risk, it was badly done and and and, like, there we were definitely gonna similar at MAST, actually. I mean, it's a one day They end it, like, three I, you know, I I I remember going and I think I had to miss sessions if I wanted to see any of the booths. So is the goal of the booths to get on a list? It's not to talk to pee like, you know, like, the booths is is a lot of time, and I'm sort of you know, as opposed to, like, a focus group, which is a dedicated hour, right, you know, as opposed to an entire day of sitting around hoping somebody's gonna show up and you can give them a pen. Like, what did you get out of the booth? And and you know, I think that's the question that I have with regard to decision making. Right. And that's it. That is the right question to ask. I will say that the booth conversations that I was able to have were high quality. And they were high quality, a, because several of the people in the focus group came up and, like, had continuations of chats with me. Cool. That was great. And b, because you know, we had Cathy there going, and Concord Consortium who sponsored our cookies and, you know, and and everybody knows about the focus group that we had this morning. Right? Like, you know, we were introduced, honestly, I should have felt a little guilty about it because nobody else got that kind of you know, custom custom stroking. So, you know, the people who came over I was able to, you know, discuss with them. They liked the at Concord. I happened to pick up a pile of the ones that had SageModeler on it that diagram seemed to be appealing. That visual, you know, spark people's interest. They would pick it up. We would have a chat. You know, I would tell them to go to the website. Which fortunately, have pens that had that address on where I am. Like, here. Go here. Go go get some. It's good. I was surprised and learned some things from those conversations. The number of people who are confusing us with someone else not always the same someone else, was high. Lot of people think that we are, oh, aren't you the guys who do? I'm like, yeah. No. Here. Here's here's what we do. Right? Here's some other things so that I can reset your your understanding. So that was great. And if there had been know, a bunch more of that, like, you know, I probably had that conversation with 10 people. If I had had it with 50, it would've totally been worthwhile. If short was helpful. Yeah. You know? I didn't mind doing the booth because it's like, you know, okay. Well, we got up. We I went to a session. I think Leslie went to a session. There were only three sessions during, you know, during the day. And and I did find it useful. Like, people who went to my session would see me at the booth, and we'd have additional conversations. People in finance group would come. We'd have additional conversations. So it was an opportunity for follow\-up. Which we wouldn't have had if if the booth wasn't there. It wasn't just a lot of outreach to new people, though. Yeah. It's just worth being clear eyed about that. But for me, the focus groups and other opportunities for us to do presentations are the point.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Yes. I think that's the main thing. And the other thing that was important, like, we did this This was minimalist booth.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Like, you could you'd walk by our booth and you couldn't really tell what Concord did. From our booth. The the the only thing we had out with any kind of visual thing on it was the at Concord the printed at and then our name. And sometimes, let's say, conquer.org. Like, you would have no idea We're gonna get more prepared for the next week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. We need our banners. We need our little projector with, like, showing moving simulations and

Me: Oh,

Them: various stuff. So it will draw people over to to us. I sent Leslie some old video montage

Me: Yep.

Them: things that I made years for doing booths or stuff like that.

Me: Yeah. We've got lots of things that we can use for that. Jie,

Them: Oh, yeah. I just saw my name in the the mass queue conference. I'm happy to help out if Daniel is taking the lead to organize it. I can I could just show up on that day because I know it's mid October? It's getting close to the kind of proposal season. I agree. I think we need to have a more kind of clear goal in here. What's the call to action? And then what are we trying to achieve? About preparation stuff? Yeah. So I'll be organizing both mask queue and masked. So my plan, I will be at mass queue for at least one of the days. I don't know if I can attend both. Just because I have a child at home with me most of the time. So You could you could bring them. It's gonna be a big draw. I haven't you haven't seen Dylan lately. There is there is no bringing her places these days. Just put, like, a Concord hat on and let her run around and Yeah. You know, be a advertiser. But that's the I'd have to tie a balloon to her so I could, like, find her wherever she Perfect. You know, ad cocker. Balloon. I love it. But yeah, so we don't know if Danielle is definitely gonna attend. We had briefly Chad and Sue and I had talked about it yesterday as, like, this might be a good opportunity for her, and we just need to kind of get an understanding of she's interested in, if this makes sense. We don't wanna just, throw her name on it and be like, here. Go talk about Concord. You've been here for a month. Right? So but, yes, I'm gonna organize it. I just I need to know that we can staff the table for two days. What are the dates again? It's October, I think. Forget exactly. I put it on my schedule. Yeah. October. The other thing that mask queue comes with, which is exactly what you guys were talking about, is a fifty minute presentation. Slot on each of the days. So we could do two fifty minute presentations that could be a focus group, or it could just be a spiel of here's our stuff. Or it could be both. One day could be the spiel, and the other day could be the focus group. Right? So with the nonprofit exhibitor registration, that's comes with it. It's two fifty minute presentation slots, one on each day. So I don't think myself or Danielle are the right people to give those presentations. Even if we are attending for both days, I think that needs to be some which is why, Dan and Jie, your names got thrown around because you've obviously done this type of thing before. If it is gonna be a focus group, we might wanna have a different conversation who whoever is comfortable leading that. Dan, you've done it. Once. So if you're available and willing to, that would probably be great. But yeah. So, basically, we need at least two to four people to volunteer to attend. You know, it doesn't have to be the same two people each day. And we'll just figure out, you know, how many more registrations we need to purchase if there are other people that wanna attend in terms of being a presenter. Etcetera. So there's budget for it. I think it mass queue is a is going to be a much broader audience than MAST or the Tri State Alliance or Arista or these you know, science teacher association smaller meetings. Mascute, Chad has been to before, and it's a it's it's teachers, it's educators, but it's also administrators. And people who are gonna make the decision on what curriculum packages get purchased or LTI tools get purchased, etcetera. So it's it's probably a better opportunity for us to kind of make connections or ask questions to the to that audience as well.

Me: Yeah.

Them: If it's an opportunity to make connections and if Chad is available, Chad has done 7,000 times the free simulations across the Concord Consortium at NSTA. So you have that sim you

Me: Yeah. And I've done Mass Q before too. I mean, I can I can obviously do that with my clothes pretty easily? I'm happy to I mean, I think that I think the first question and, you know, what Amy's and other people's comments in mind, which I agree with, is can we use, you know, any of or all these for focus group as well? I mean, I think it is great. To, you know, know about our groupies in Massachusetts and to get people to our name who don't. I think we should do that. But, like, if if it were that versus we could run two focus groups on two different days at mass queue, like, right at the moment, I'd much rather just turn them into focus groups. And with that because I think we would learn lot.

Them: I would just I would right. One argument for having you do it, Chad, and having Danielle because if Danielle could be there watching you do it, it

Me: Right.

Them: it's it's like, it's an opportunity for her to learn to learn your presentation style, to understand you know, look around the room too and get a read on the room. Like, there's a here.

Me: Yeah. It's possible as well. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: That's the first two months. I think I think the question is is presentation versus focus group. And and And if there's one today,

Me: Yeah. And it may yep. And it and it may not be either or maybe both in So if we can find out more as you're asking questions, Kiley, about MassQ, because that's the sooner one to understand what the I mean, the, yeah, the exhibitor things similar or different. Sometimes the exhibitor ones are like in the exhibitor, you know, thing way down the hall into the left, which is feels very different than the presentations to

Them: Yeah. I I would be interested in in at least note taking whatever, seeing how the focus group goes. I'm, you know, not interested in doing a presentation on all Concord stuff because I'm just not that

Me: Sure.

Them: broadly educated at the moment. And and, you know, so so depending on what is being set up for it is it's important. Again, I do think that we need more focus group If we can get that in, that's important because I think, you know, one focus group is interesting. We went down a a rabbit hole with with regard to, you know, the open world. Is this gonna happen again? Question mark. Question mark. Right? You know? What else comes up? You know, in terms of the kinds of questions that are being asked?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And and so I'm interested in in the focus group kind of, you know, idea and wanna support that. So Leslie just put in the chat here. If you also in theory, you have fifteen minute interview sign up booth. There's lots of opportunities here

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: for that. We used to have a survey that everybody gave. So NSTA twenty twenty four, everybody who did well, several you who went to NSTA twenty twenty four, had a survey at the end or URL. Go here. We got a bunch of responses. We have those on SurveyMonkey. 12 people of the six of the people who responded said they would be willing for to have a follow\-up conversation with us. So, like, every time we're have the opportunity to say, you know, do a survey. We can have an iPad that has survey running. Answer three questions or That could be on our booth. There are so many opportunities here, which is why I'm wondering about the order of this agenda. The next thing on the agenda is the users user discovery coach. Under like, I don't understand if we're hiring somebody and they're gonna help us whether it's Mike Sugarman or somebody else, but help us understand how to do all these surveys, ask the focus group questions, and so on and so forth, because there's there's lots of things I'm not sure we're availing ourselves of all of the opportunities.

Me: Yeah. No. We're we're we're not in the

Them: Because for a few people. Right? I mean Oh, I

Me: Yep. Exactly. Yep.

Them: I but a survey on an iPad is not a it's not a time And again,

Me: Got it.

Them: you know, Cynthia, I mentioned this last time is the survey you you know, they're limited in terms of and what are you you know, having that conversation which is why this you know, how rich the conversation was from just the focus group in in in the tristate from us was because there was conversation whereas the survey was like, okay. The SWAT survey

Me: Yeah.

Them: You know, like But this survey That's where I think

Me: Sure.

Them: you know, you know, and why this is first, you know, is also because these opportunities are up and near, and we have to make decisions.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Right? And so so I think, you know, we have to decide, are we attending all of these, including this one Kentucky option, which, you know, has come up also. These have to be decided on.

Me: And it's not it's not either or, or or with the service even. Yep.

Them: I'm guessing I'll just right. I would like to just finish. Right? Right. So when we asked it is 2024, would you be interested in would you be willing to hear have a conversation with us? So people answered a survey, and they could we could then call them. One of the things that Dan started with when he just described the what happened in the focus group was maybe the first person who started talking happened to lead you the conversation down a down a rabbit hole. Just because of the nature of that person's observation, the question, the whatever, you all start start talking that way. That might happen at focus groups. Great. And it's a conversation people are but it's a conversation that might have been, in fact, bent towards that first person. When you have a one on one, you have an opportunity to ask more focused questions and just listen to one person. Which happened at your booth when you had follow\-up conversations. These are follow\-up conversations.

Me: Yeah.

Them: I just wanted to let's see. I'm not these are all lovely. They're wonderful, and some of them are incredibly low stakes. Put an iPad there is not I'm not asking for time or resources or anything. We have an iPad. Put a survey with one big fat orange button that says take a survey. Two quest

Me: Yep. Yeah. So I think I think all of these are are right, and the the reason that talk about coaches is to help coordinate these things. And we're teeing in in anything, we're sort of teeing up, you know, with that person for more success to help us process and and run these. I think that's that's great. I no reason we can't have an iPad with a survey or a u r a QR code and make that a drawing, you know, at the booth or something like that. I mean, that's incredibly easy. And and, yes, you know, to to Amy's point, I mean, yeah, we're laying this all out because we're you know, need to do it right now. That's all fine. You know, in the background, I'm, you know, working in to you know, some opt options for people we who can, you know, help usher this forward and sort of look across the the range of it. And what you're saying is right as well, Cynthia, which is I see at least three layers of user discovery that we want to plunge forward on and, you know, hopefully, we've got a guide to help us do it, but we know wanna do. One of them is these focus groups. Another one is individual conversations with users. You know, we've got lots names of people who love us already or who've said, yes. You can call us. At these focus groups, we have more names of people who we want to follow\-up with. I want to talk to that teacher who customized a curriculum around Open Sci Ed or what have you. And those are easy to set up online via Zoom as fifteen minute We've done that before in the post project. We are, you know, working on some separate tracks on sort of prototype and development and testing, you know, sprint week kinds of things, which is a a different animal, but the same neighborhood. So we can do all of those at the same time. And we should do them opportunistically as as have energy and and space right now and get somebody to coordinate them more. Going forward. Mhmm. So, yes, let's talk about the Kentucky idea and what input we need to understand understand that before we disappear.

Them: Before you do that, can I just

Me: Yes.

Them: I know that every I heard a few things? Is two days. So I just like, I need to know that we have both days covered. I didn't hear a definitive from Dan or Jay about what Yeah. I'm I'm a yes. Okay. I can do either stay Whole things. But Sorry. Yeah. I can do either stay. Probably

Me: Great.

Them: Thursday is sorry. It's delay. Sorry. Go ahead, Jie. Oh, yeah. I just I could sign up for either day, probably Thursday. Oh, sorry. Wednesday is a little bit better. The fifteenth is a little bit better for me. Right. So Depends on, you know, when it when the meeting ends. Okay. It's it's probably a whole day thing. It's in Foxborough at Gillette Stadium. Yeah. Then Wednesday is slightly better. Okay. And, Dan, so can I put you down? Be willing to do a a talk and do some booth duty. And if we have a focus group, I'm happy to participate and try and with that. Okay. So I'll put Dan down for Thursday. Like, basically, I'm looking at Dan and Jay. If we're doing present, presentations, I think you two would be the best fit. So at least one of you can you one of you can present on each day. And then I think between Amy, I think you said you could be at one of the days And Leslie, I think you said you'd be at one of the days. So between the three of us, and then maybe Danielle's participation as well, like, we'll have the booth covered. What is the presentation? Is it gonna be just a topic that we're or familiar with, our own project, or just Concord in general?

Me: It's it's an unclear, un unclear, but it might

Them: It's

Me: be your your choice or or what have you if it's not a focus group.

Them: have to look at who who are the conference attendees. The conference unclear. It's not unclear.

Me: Right. Yeah. But the the point the point being that you don't

Them: There's an RFP. Okay. I'll send it. We'll see if I have a

Me: you

Them: situation on what it needs to be. I am not able to

Me: yeah.

Them: apply to it yet because the RFP is closed. So I put a mail out to the conference organizers, and I just needed to know that I have two people

Me: Yeah.

Them: that can talk about Concord stuff on each day.

Me: Worst case scenario, you can decide what you wanna talk about in some subset of your work.

Them: And then Mhmm.

Me: You know, best case scenario, in my mind, we turn them into focus groups, and we don't have to worry about presenting. But

Them: Okay. Cool. Now we can talk about

Me: yeah. So we got five to seven minutes to talk about Kentucky and make sure that informed enough to know and decide whatever we need to know and decide. Mhmm.

Them: Alright. So so Stephanie Harmon is a main is to arrange a breakfast sponsored focus group at the Kentucky STA Science Teachers Association. She was like, I could get 35 to 40 people, you know, and we're like, that's not too much. Right? And so but, you know, part of the question of a, it's a different part of the country, b, it's, you know, you know, it's sponsor, meaning we have to bring you know, provide food, and we're gonna have to send somebody down there to do this. So so is this and that's November, I think, is when

Me: Yep.

Them: the Kentucky assigned teachers association, So you know, this is a question of do we want to to going to Richmond, Kentucky? I think that's where it is. I'm not sure, which is South Of Lexington. It's not simple to get to to get to Kentucky. But, you know, again, the focus group idea is is the opportunity are we you know, will to spend the money for that? It's very different to have to do travel, etcetera. And and that starts to add up in terms of cost, in terms of time, in terms of who should be doing it, you know, in terms of practice at focus groups. By then, we'll have done mass q also, you know, that kind of thing if we can get it. But I I need to sort of let her know whether or not to continue to pursue and to pursue with 10, 15 people be a reasonable number for a breakfast? Essentially, because the lunch and and other opportunities have already been taken. So I'm seeing a Leslie shaking her head, You know? Yes. And but what does that mean, and how do, you know, like, how do we think about this? Is Kentucky a place where there's a less competitors already kind of occupying the market. I I feel like Massachusetts is very, like, busy. Like, everyone is here. Right? So so we go to mass queue or mass to wherever we go, we're gonna kinda be washed out. But you go to places like don't just know don't know about about Kentucky, but maybe Oregon or Mississippi. Those places are you know, there's less people paying attention to the market. Right. So Kentucky has put a lot of effort into upping their science. Through a lot of grant funding as well as professional development, and then they've been making progress. They are also an open CYAD adopter type state, And, you know, I think that they are dealing with the know, way more interesting questions around what it means to be educating rural and and and you know, the the population is different enough that I think, how how they adopted all the technology you know, through COVID and beyond, you know, as changed what's going on in Kentucky. I think there's a lot of you know, evolution of what's happening there. It's an interesting state, I think, I don't know in terms of competitor what that all means, you know, because they do have they're they're thoughtful, and they're also doing interesting stuff with around their standards and state testing and stuff like that. So All all states at this point have had to develop a strategy

Me: Yep.

Them: and a technology baseline. My suspicion is that it's different Right? You're gonna just have, like, a different cross section

Me: I mean, I think you can't get much different

Them: of

Me: than Massachusetts than to go to Kentucky. And I

Them: That is an no.

Me: that, you know, that alone might be highly valuable. California is not our Massachusetts isn't hard. Kentucky is harder and definitely, you know, different. And we go to Kentucky and we hear the same things we're hearing in Massachusetts, that tells us a lot, it feels like. Right? If we hear different things, that tells us something else.

Them: Yep. We're also gonna get better at, like, doing these kinds of probing conversations. And so, you know, just in the repetition, there is some value

Me: Right.

Them: So, Amy, your question, I guess, about the breakfast. If we are gonna do that. And I think we should that you wouldn't believe how much goodwill there was. Oh my god. Concord bought us cookies. Jesus Christ. Right? Like, it's just a cookie. Right. Right. And and people didn't even eat them. Oh my god. Right? But so so, like, there's a there's a lot to that. Particularly if you are then asking them. For their opinion, to spend a little time with you, to have a conversation with you. Right? Like, it breaks ice in a beautiful way. But my hope would be that there would be, you know, you and even if it's just you and and a couple of your friends like Stephanie, sitting at each of the tables and and guiding the conversation. Right? People are gonna talk about something while they're having breakfast, Let's make it something that we care about. Right? And then write down what you hear. You know?

Me: You can Yeah. I mean, from from logistics standpoint, you know, it's actually not as crazy as it seems in the background here. I mean, it's $270 for a a round trip flight. It's an hour and a half drive from Cincinnati It's not actually completely insane to to get there. So, you know, I think it's I think it's reasonable to imagine going down And I'm sure we get a lot and one could imagine, you know, any combination of one day where we do a lunch instead of a breakfast and you you come back in a red eye and it's insane. Or for a couple days, do geoscience meetup at night or something. I mean, we found meetups, for example, get a lot of goodwill as well. And, like, you just say open tab at the bar, and it's, like, $300 for $200 for people to you know, it's, like, very actually cost efficient to get people together and get your name out there. So there might be ways to do know, various thing. So I feel like telling her, yes, what are the know, figure out what some options are for small teachers. Without a big you know, don't don't commit to something quite yet unless we have to. But if we find out that there's a chance to do something on day one and day two and it's 500, $700 to get down there and back, sure, whatever.

Them: Right. I mean, right now, I think the opportunity is the breakfast as a sponsor. Thing so that comes with Concord's name, and that's what she can you know, like, other the other things that are happening over the days have already been taken up by other people as far as I can tell. So

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so I will see, and then, you know, we can we can

Me: Yeah.

Them: figure out the cost and what it means and if there's other things to do and if it's just me going or if there's you know, somebody who's been doing these focus groups who's doing it so that there's familiarity. Like, what we can talk, it doesn't have to be me. I'm happy to do it. But

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, I just wanted to get back to Stephanie today because she

Me: Mhmm. I think we should definitely take advantage of it one way or another. And so

Them: Thirty seconds on Arista. The request has been caught up introduction and how it's used in open sci ed curriculum.

Me: Yep. Okay.

Them: That was the specific request. Can we do a presentation on that? I'm I'm I'm leaning toward yes.

Me: Sure. That's fine. We it it exists. We can do that.

Them: That's the minimum thing, and maybe we can turn it into

Me: Yeah.

Them: focus group time.

Me: That'd be awesome as well.

Them: So I I also feel like, you know, muffins here, cookies here. You know, my my little check writing heart is starting to get nervous. But but it's little, so we won't worry about it too much. But I think that I also hear, like, this could be a thread for Danielle to pick up on and write, you know, funders to to fund going forward. Do the series focus group. Right. Exactly. In and Missouri. And, you know, like, we're just

Me: Right.

Them: starting to build a base of, like, what questions asked and what we still wanna ask and things like that. So

Me: Yeah. $77,000 or $15,000 from random foundation would buy us a lot of plane trips to fly around.

Them: Or a 100,000\. You can buy us more.

Me: And, Jie, you got a question in the negative thirty seconds we have?

Them: Yeah. So so the primary goal of going to these conferences is to getting chance to meet

Me: Yeah. Right now, yes. I think that is the primary goal.

Them: people to do the focus group. So if we're not limited to in person focus group or in person interview, I think it's probably we can also recruit teachers from our existing current participating teachers. We have tons of those teachers.

Me: Yes. So so option

Them: Even just within my own project, I can

Me: option two, yeah, option two of of three plus

Them: probably at least yeah.

Me: is to is individual interviews and conversations, and we should talk more about that as another mode because, yes, and entirely.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And so let let's put a pin in that and make sure we, you know, revisit how to to do that in a structured way because I think there's a huge huge set of information to dive into

Them: Yeah. Because those are not just the cold call, you know,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: through our newsletter to call people. Those are the people who are working with

Me: Yep.

Them: us, receiving

Me: Mhmm.

Them: paycheck from us right now. We can

Me: Exactly. And and that that comes with both the good and the and the the complex side. So

Them: call and help.

Me: yes. Yes. Entirely.

Them: I I think I think what we need most next is the list of things we want to know. Greg, could

Me: Yes. I completely agree.

Them: I I went very general I went fishing. With my last group of focus group questions as Mike advised me to do. That doesn't mean that that that it has to stay that way. It certainly Right? So, you know, we can look at that list of questions, decide if some of them are better at focus groups and some of them are better one on one or whatever, you know, or we're gonna do the same questions in both scenarios, see if there's a difference between the kinds of conversations

Me: Yep.

Them: that we have. Right? All that's good.

Me: Yeah. Totally agree. Awesome. Thank you all. Appreciate it.
