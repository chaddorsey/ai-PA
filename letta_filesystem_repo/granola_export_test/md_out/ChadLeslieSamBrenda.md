00:00:00\.100 \-\-\> 00:00:01\.550

Chad Dorsey: We will… Yeah.

2

00:00:02\.210 \-\-\> 00:00:07\.670

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Sometimes there's a screen share or something that is not something I can just capture in notes, right?

3

00:00:09\.090 \-\-\> 00:00:18\.950

Chad Dorsey: Yeah. Yeah, and, Sam and Brenda, I gave Leslie a little bit of background, but give your one or two sentences, who you say you are to people.

4

00:00:20\.140 \-\-\> 00:00:23\.340

Chad Dorsey: Depends on who's asking.

5

00:00:24\.710 \-\-\> 00:00:35\.229

Sam Berg: I'm Sam Berg, I coordinate computer science in OUSD, so trying to figure out, like, what computer science looks like K\-12, and also, I think, the way they're sort of involved in this work is

6

00:00:35\.820 \-\-\> 00:00:43\.790

Sam Berg: where does… where does computer science or computer science ideas fit into core curriculum? So, with data science, like, where are we looking at things?

7

00:00:43\.840 \-\-\> 00:01:00\.189

Sam Berg: in a science class, something you might learn in computer science class that you're taking to science class, or something that you, are looking at in math or social science, so… and then what are the tools that we could give to folks to say, like, hey, we know you had students,

8

00:01:00\.610 \-\-\> 00:01:03\.139

Sam Berg: For their capstone, survey a bunch of people, like…

9

00:01:03\.290 \-\-\> 00:01:17\.440

Sam Berg: here's a better way to do it than Google Sheets. There's this thing called CODAP, and so, like, trying to think about, like, how that kind of stuff works to get… get those ways of thinking, both K\-12, but also, like, spread across,

10

00:01:17\.740 \-\-\> 00:01:20\.749

Sam Berg: Across subject areas.

11

00:01:21\.950 \-\-\> 00:01:23\.340

Chad Dorsey: That's great.

12

00:01:23\.740 \-\-\> 00:01:27\.670

Brenda Tuohy: So, I'm Brenda Toohey, I work with Sam, …

13

00:01:27\.810 \-\-\> 00:01:36\.880

Brenda Tuohy: I'm a district instructional coach. I support computer science and engineering teachers. I'm a former elementary science teacher myself.

14

00:01:37\.170 \-\-\> 00:01:44\.400

Brenda Tuohy: And I first… I first met Kodak a few years ago. We did a project to develop

15

00:01:44\.530 \-\-\> 00:01:52\.250

Brenda Tuohy: a unit of study on data science for middle school, and we're trying to find… figure out what's the right tool. And…

16

00:01:54\.750 \-\-\> 00:02:08\.709

Brenda Tuohy: like, Sam's a computer science person by training. I'm a computer science person kind of by serendipity, I would say. And so, like, one thing as somebody who's a computer science learner.

17

00:02:08\.990 \-\-\> 00:02:22\.820

Brenda Tuohy: I think the elegance of CODAP is that it's, it's, it's very accessible for somebody who doesn't have a lot of experience with data science, with computer science, with programming, but you can get to pretty high\-level

18

00:02:23\.750 \-\-\> 00:02:31\.260

Brenda Tuohy: It's a way to analyze data in a sophisticated way without having a lot of sophisticated knowledge?

19

00:02:31\.290 \-\-\> 00:02:31\.880

Chad Dorsey: Hmm.

20

00:02:31\.880 \-\-\> 00:02:32\.510

Brenda Tuohy: ….

21

00:02:33\.330 \-\-\> 00:02:38\.679

Brenda Tuohy: And so I just think it's… it's… there's… it's got a lot of potential. Yeah, so…

22

00:02:39\.410 \-\-\> 00:02:44\.340

Brenda Tuohy: That's… that's… that's me. And why I love Kodak, which wasn't the question, but….

23

00:02:44\.340 \-\-\> 00:02:45\.139

Chad Dorsey: That's okay, no.

24

00:02:45\.140 \-\-\> 00:02:45\.780

Brenda Tuohy: I love that shit, too.

25

00:02:45\.780 \-\-\> 00:02:47\.319

Chad Dorsey: Very useful introduction.

26

00:02:47\.320 \-\-\> 00:02:48\.000

Brenda Tuohy: No, then.

27

00:02:48\.000 \-\-\> 00:03:02\.990

Chad Dorsey: Overall. So one of the things that you both were sort of alluding to is the fact that, you know, you think about resources and getting them out to lots of teachers, and, you know, we're…

28

00:03:02\.990 \-\-\> 00:03:25\.239

Chad Dorsey: we're interested in, sort of, you know, maybe first, what mechanisms do you have to do that? If I'm a teacher and I'm trying to use a resource, do I, you know, just ask for it? Do I go in and find it on a list? Do I go into a system? Is there an LMS that people use for anything? Or is there an LMS that people don't use for anything?

29

00:03:26\.740 \-\-\> 00:03:35\.769

Sam Berg: I don't know how much you understand about Oakland, but everybody here does everything all the time, and so there's, like, yes and no to all of that. There are some…

30

00:03:36\.240 \-\-\> 00:03:42\.080

Sam Berg: There are some, like, different schools have different LMSs, …

31

00:03:43\.520 \-\-\> 00:03:50\.900

Sam Berg: There's, like, sort of a central… and we're not a part of that, like, … more like, ….

32

00:03:50\.900 \-\-\> 00:03:52\.460

Brenda Tuohy: Instructional technology.

33

00:03:52\.460 \-\-\> 00:04:00\.869

Sam Berg: instructional tech team that approves apps and, like, says, like, oh, these are the ones you should use, these are the ones that are on the Clever dashboard.

34

00:04:00\.890 \-\-\> 00:04:19\.570

Sam Berg: I will say Clever's used pretty regularly by elementary schools and that dashboard. It's… it's… the further you go up, the less it gets. There's also a lot of teachers that find a thing, and they're like, hey, I want to use this, and they get the free version, or the kids, and they… they just have kids sort of log in.

35

00:04:19\.910 \-\-\> 00:04:22\.850

Sam Berg: One of the things I learned is…

36

00:04:22\.850 \-\-\> 00:04:40\.590

Sam Berg: that if you want to have… like, we set up a small contract with the company to provide some services for us, and then at that point, when I tried to pay for something, there's a whole lot of things the company had to have, like a data sharing… a data privacy agreement, and all these things, and they were super… it was started by a former teacher of ours.

37

00:04:40\.590 \-\-\> 00:04:44\.699

Sam Berg: He was very new and, like, didn't have that, but there's, like, a process to that.

38

00:04:44\.730 \-\-\> 00:04:45\.560

Sam Berg: …

39

00:04:45\.830 \-\-\> 00:04:50\.849

Sam Berg: if I was a teacher, I could just… I'm not supposed to, but a lot of people just have a thing that they've, like.

40

00:04:51\.050 \-\-\> 00:05:01\.920

Sam Berg: I found this somewhere, somebody sent this to me, everybody, all the kids log into that. So it's, … it's sort of a mishmash of, like, how info gets out, what people use, there's not…

41

00:05:02\.490 \-\-\> 00:05:08\.309

Sam Berg: There's not, like… you… there's supposed to be lanes, they're not always followed, I guess is what I would say to that.

42

00:05:09\.200 \-\-\> 00:05:13\.570

Brenda Tuohy: And part of it is in our district. Sam, is it 6th grade when students' emails are activated?

43

00:05:14\.710 \-\-\> 00:05:16\.179

Sam Berg: Yes. You get an email.

44

00:05:16\.180 \-\-\> 00:05:26\.989

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah, so students all have, like, their email that they use for their single sign\-on, but they don't even know… they don't have access to that until they're in middle school, so that's… so in elementary school, they're all limited.

45

00:05:27\.170 \-\-\> 00:05:29\.920

Brenda Tuohy: to Clever, they access everything through Clever.

46

00:05:29\.920 \-\-\> 00:05:30\.720

Sam Berg: Yes.

47

00:05:32\.270 \-\-\> 00:05:39\.190

Sam Berg: And then those emails… When you're on the district system, you can only get to certain things. …

48

00:05:39\.900 \-\-\> 00:05:57\.229

Sam Berg: So, like, you can't put in… like, I can't log into an OUSD Chromebook, without an OUSD email, so students are, like, in that ecosystem. There are some boundaries on it. The other thing about us is that we are a Google district.

49

00:05:57\.350 \-\-\> 00:06:08\.580

Sam Berg: So, kids have Gmail, they have Google Drive, some people… some classrooms, some teachers use Google Classroom, whereas others use a Schoology or something like that, so…

50

00:06:09\.260 \-\-\> 00:06:10\.480

Sam Berg: Cool.

51

00:06:10\.480 \-\-\> 00:06:21\.139

Chad Dorsey: And that… and that decision is by teacher, by school? Is there professional development, or incentive or desire to use one system versus another for those school classroom Schoology?

52

00:06:21\.800 \-\-\> 00:06:22\.970

Sam Berg: schools make…

53

00:06:24\.350 \-\-\> 00:06:41\.469

Sam Berg: I think middle school has decided that they're using Schoology. I think some people then still choose to use Google Classroom, or at least one teacher that I was talking about still uses Google Classroom. I don't know if his school also doesn't use Schoology, and just uses Google, or he just likes Google Classroom better.

54

00:06:41\.780 \-\-\> 00:06:44\.209

Sam Berg: High school's a little more, …

55

00:06:44\.470 \-\-\> 00:06:51\.949

Sam Berg: Wild West, in terms of, like, if they have an LMS, if they don't have an LMS, like, what… what exists there?

56

00:06:53\.710 \-\-\> 00:07:02\.560

Sam Berg: But everybody has Google… everybody… the one thing that everybody does have is… is Google products, Google Drive, Google Sheets, access to all those kind of things.

57

00:07:03\.000 \-\-\> 00:07:09\.070

Sam Berg: Which they lose at the end of high school, which is sometimes a little bit of a thing, but it is a… it is a, like…

58

00:07:09\.170 \-\-\> 00:07:20\.730

Sam Berg: once you graduate, you no longer have an account, so if you wanted to pull something from your Google Drive, you should have downloaded that. You should have downloaded that, which almost no one does, and then feels sad about later.

59

00:07:20\.730 \-\-\> 00:07:23\.990

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Right, which is a different kind of problem.

60

00:07:23\.990 \-\-\> 00:07:24\.740

Sam Berg: Yes.

61

00:07:24\.740 \-\-\> 00:07:40\.739

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): But for the duration of time, from, like, whatever school on, if… if a teacher wanted to adopt something, or if, Brenda, you wanted to push something out to a bunch of teachers, you could guaranteed be able to do it if it was accessible to Google Drive.

62

00:07:40\.990 \-\-\> 00:07:41\.390

Sam Berg: Yes.

63

00:07:42\.080 \-\-\> 00:07:45\.119

Sam Berg: The accessibility in Google Drive is, like, the key…

64

00:07:45\.470 \-\-\> 00:07:49\.870

Sam Berg: to the whole system, because people end up linking

65

00:07:49\.990 \-\-\> 00:08:04\.569

Sam Berg: things from Google to their Schoology, or if they have a different LMS or their Google Classroom. There used to be some Canvas stuff, but also then would sometimes people would link Google Docs and all that stuff, too. So that's… that's kind of the, …

66

00:08:04\.810 \-\-\> 00:08:11\.959

Sam Berg: the one… Constant in the… a system that has a lot of, different factors going on.

67

00:08:12\.370 \-\-\> 00:08:15\.069

Chad Dorsey: And it sounds as if there aren't…

68

00:08:15\.350 \-\-\> 00:08:38\.879

Chad Dorsey: it sounds as if there aren't necessarily either consistent barriers or consistent accelerants to adopting something. You know, the barriers, maybe, if there's money involved, it sounds like there's a wall of barriers, but it sounds as if the, you know, things I just found don't necessarily have barriers in reality, even if they might on paper.

69

00:08:38\.880 \-\-\> 00:08:39\.690

Chad Dorsey: ….

70

00:08:39\.690 \-\-\> 00:08:51\.219

Sam Berg: Yeah, the only… every once in a while, some things get blocked, but, like, it's more like trying to block games or things like that, I think. Most… most things that are involved in… like, it's… I think…

71

00:08:51\.600 \-\-\> 00:08:54\.539

Sam Berg: I think the default is it's open.

72

00:08:55\.310 \-\-\> 00:09:00\.060

Sam Berg: And then specific things get blocked if, …

73

00:09:00\.230 \-\-\> 00:09:04\.770

Sam Berg: If people complain, or they see that, like, a lot of people are going to Muslim.

74

00:09:05\.350 \-\-\> 00:09:06\.420

Chad Dorsey: …

75

00:09:06\.940 \-\-\> 00:09:31\.879

Chad Dorsey: you're talking about digital… access to digital resources and talking about things much of the time. Does that mean that that's the digital resources that get used, or are there curricula or examples of times when people are using digital resources sort of consistently as part of an ongoing classroom experience, as opposed to, here's an app I like, or something like that? And if so, is that different in terms of how

76

00:09:31\.880 \-\-\> 00:09:33\.750

Chad Dorsey: It gets connected, rolled out, whatever.

77

00:09:34\.750 \-\-\> 00:09:52\.229

Sam Berg: So, for example, we use code.org for our, we… for our curriculum in middle school and in high school. Kids log on, to code.org through their platform, and then they do their work in that space, so that exists. There's also, …

78

00:09:53\.920 \-\-\> 00:10:05\.550

Sam Berg: adopted math curriculum, which has… I don't know that we have the online… we use IM, I don't know if we have the online access as well, but also….

79

00:10:05\.550 \-\-\> 00:10:06\.310

Brenda Tuohy: Moss.

80

00:10:06\.730 \-\-\> 00:10:18\.860

Sam Berg: the Desmos platform, which, I think there is some online stuff that we don't, don't subscribe to about that piece. And then some of the other… there's other subject areas, there's also some…

81

00:10:18\.860 \-\-\> 00:10:27\.669

Sam Berg: both physical materials and some online materials as well. Those curriculum… not Code.org, but, like, IAM,

82

00:10:27\.750 \-\-\> 00:10:40\.039

Sam Berg: the English curriculum, fish tank, the science curriculum, those have all been adopted by board, and so we have a board, there's a process to go through the board, and there's a contract, here's what that means, kind of….

83

00:10:40\.650 \-\-\> 00:10:55\.519

Chad Dorsey: But it sounds like, you know, I would be much more likely to find a paper or textbook for any of those things, and the student wouldn't, four days out of the week, be turning in an assignment online that they've been doing in a consistent curriculum. It's not like the digital curriculum is the norm or anything, it sounds like.

84

00:10:57\.850 \-\-\> 00:11:04\.899

Brenda Tuohy: It's amazing. I mean, by high school, kids are doing a lot of their work online. I would say more work than I feel like is pedagogically sound.

85

00:11:04\.900 \-\-\> 00:11:05\.290

Chad Dorsey: stick in the.

86

00:11:05\.290 \-\-\> 00:11:07\.590

Brenda Tuohy: It's easier for teachers.

87

00:11:07\.590 \-\-\> 00:11:08\.210

Sam Berg: else.

88

00:11:08\.210 \-\-\> 00:11:19\.340

Chad Dorsey: But is that the teacher created, as opposed to, I'm logging on to the Pearson textbook and their system four times a week, or something like that. It's… teachers give online assignments and turn them in online.

89

00:11:19\.340 \-\-\> 00:11:19\.810

Brenda Tuohy: Yes.

90

00:11:19\.810 \-\-\> 00:11:20\.130

Chad Dorsey: Okay.

91

00:11:20\.130 \-\-\> 00:11:20\.680

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah.

92

00:11:21\.940 \-\-\> 00:11:22\.869

Chad Dorsey: It's interesting.

93

00:11:24\.440 \-\-\> 00:11:28\.449

Chad Dorsey: Okay, what am I missing? Now, Leslie, go.

94

00:11:28\.450 \-\-\> 00:11:30\.549

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): How much customization…

95

00:11:31\.120 \-\-\> 00:11:45\.840

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): are people doing? Like, if, you know, if you find a really great curriculum, or tool, or whatever, you know, are they just using things that other people have said, yeah, here's the way the lesson goes, or are they, you know, branching out?

96

00:11:49\.360 \-\-\> 00:11:50\.800

Sam Berg: Can you say that one more time?

97

00:11:52\.860 \-\-\> 00:11:57\.399

Chad Dorsey: You mean professionally provided resources that they're modifying? Is that what you're asking about?

98

00:11:57\.400 \-\-\> 00:12:12\.470

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Yeah, right? Like, if you've got a Pearson tool that the district has adopted, let's say, are they just following along with the program exactly as identified, or do they make their own stuff?

99

00:12:12\.470 \-\-\> 00:12:19\.390

Brenda Tuohy: I was gonna say, like, Sam and I, both as, like, just, like, curriculum people, like, we wish that teachers would use the curriculum they had more.

100

00:12:20\.590 \-\-\> 00:12:27\.859

Brenda Tuohy: So, like, is there a lot of innovation? Yes. Is there a lot of flexibility? Yes. Are people just, like, using things that they find all the time?

101

00:12:28\.620 \-\-\> 00:12:31\.889

Brenda Tuohy: 100%. And I think, honestly, a lot of that comes to…

102

00:12:32\.540 \-\-\> 00:12:37\.279

Brenda Tuohy: Lack of time and resources for professional development.

103

00:12:37\.430 \-\-\> 00:12:37\.970

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): None.

104

00:12:37\.970 \-\-\> 00:12:53\.540

Brenda Tuohy: teachers don't… often don't even know, what's available to them, or haven't had the experience to really kind of, like, dig in and see how instructionally sound it is. So it's like, stop finding stuff that you made up on the internet.

105

00:12:53\.720 \-\-\> 00:12:54\.420

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah.

106

00:12:54\.760 \-\-\> 00:13:00\.250

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Well, okay, but… Yes, and… Yes.

107

00:13:00\.250 \-\-\> 00:13:00\.820

Brenda Tuohy: and….

108

00:13:00\.820 \-\-\> 00:13:05\.149

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Yes, and I want to meet these folks where they are, right?

109

00:13:05\.500 \-\-\> 00:13:13\.010

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): doing this, then there's something about that model that works for them, which I want to respect.

110

00:13:13\.010 \-\-\> 00:13:27\.160

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): if… so, there they are, and they're sitting at their desk at home the night before, and they're like, I gotta get all my kids to do a thing. What do they do? Do they make a Google Sheet with the instructions for login and etc?

111

00:13:28\.470 \-\-\> 00:13:32\.989

Sam Berg: … Like, they need kids to log into a thing.

112

00:13:32\.990 \-\-\> 00:13:33\.450

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Sure.

113

00:13:33\.450 \-\-\> 00:13:40\.430

Sam Berg: Often, it could be, like, a bit.ly, or if you have Google Classroom or Schoology, or something like that, you can just make a Google Doc.

114

00:13:40\.430 \-\-\> 00:13:41\.530

Brenda Tuohy: Chatty Yoshi.

115

00:13:41\.660 \-\-\> 00:13:47\.649

Sam Berg: put the link in there, and then kids will click on it to get into that… get into that space.

116

00:13:48\.620 \-\-\> 00:13:50\.400

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Right. The other thing that I think….

117

00:13:50\.670 \-\-\> 00:13:58\.569

Sam Berg: So that's… can be tricky. The other thing that's tricky is when you want the kids to save their work, or turn something in.

118

00:13:58\.570 \-\-\> 00:13:59\.440

Chad Dorsey: about that?

119

00:13:59\.440 \-\-\> 00:14:02\.499

Sam Berg: How to get back through…

120

00:14:02\.970 \-\-\> 00:14:17\.080

Sam Berg: like, that was a thing that came up when we were using Kodab, was like, kids made a thing, and it's like, okay, now they want to share it to their drive, and then there's a couple different steps, and I think we talked about that, and you said that was on Google's… like, Google made that process hard, and so that was a…

121

00:14:17\.360 \-\-\> 00:14:20\.120

Sam Berg: That was, a thing, but yeah.

122

00:14:21\.130 \-\-\> 00:14:29\.019

Chad Dorsey: Is there a consistency to how people… I mean, so, is that a pain point, turning things in, and for whom and why?

123

00:14:30\.050 \-\-\> 00:14:34\.030

Sam Berg: I think it's a pain point if you're not in something.

124

00:14:34\.740 \-\-\> 00:14:38\.309

Sam Berg: Let's easily put into the Google… into Google Drive.

125

00:14:39\.120 \-\-\> 00:14:44\.759

Sam Berg: So, if it was an outside app to get the work into the, …

126

00:14:45\.130 \-\-\> 00:14:57\.440

Sam Berg: Google Drive, where then you can share it and do all those things, that can be tricky. And, I think there are folks that are like, it's not worth it, because I can't get across this barrier.

127

00:15:00\.050 \-\-\> 00:15:19\.180

Chad Dorsey: If it's, if I can do that, and get my students to turn something on Google Drive, what do I do with it then? Do I, grade it? And if so, how do I get feedback to them about that? Etc, right? I mean, I just got a whole bunch of Google Docs or PDFs, right?

128

00:15:20\.960 \-\-\> 00:15:30\.299

Brenda Tuohy: That's why, like, a lot of teachers, like, will use Google Classroom, because then students are submitting the assignment, and then the teacher… like, are you familiar with the, like, the back end of Google Classroom?

129

00:15:31\.260 \-\-\> 00:15:37\.409

Brenda Tuohy: So then, like, that's where teachers will get the comments, and the kids can see it, and it's all, like, through Google Classroom, or Schoology, or Jupiter.

130

00:15:37\.410 \-\-\> 00:15:41\.939

Sam Berg: Same, yeah, that, same, that, often it's inside of that, …

131

00:15:42\.990 \-\-\> 00:15:45\.510

Sam Berg: Whatever that platform is that they're using.

132

00:15:45\.750 \-\-\> 00:16:08\.769

Chad Dorsey: So if they're giving digital feed… so it sounds like if they're giving digital feedback, and it sounds like most of them are, in some way or another, giving feedback digitally on some digital assignment that's turned in, you know, semi\-frequently, at least a couple times a week, maybe, if… maybe once a week. If they're doing that, they're doing that feedback through their platform of choice, and they need something that can be turned in on that platform of choice.

133

00:16:08\.770 \-\-\> 00:16:09\.330

Brenda Tuohy: Yep.

134

00:16:09\.770 \-\-\> 00:16:14\.880

Sam Berg: Whereas, like, on the code.org… and the Code.org ecosystem.

135

00:16:15\.040 \-\-\> 00:16:30\.100

Sam Berg: they're often just doing it inside, because that feature exists within Code.org, so they're… they're saying, like, oh, okay, like, I'm looking at your program now, and there's a place where you can write some comments, or… or… and so that's just happening, and then that is getting

136

00:16:30\.380 \-\-\> 00:16:32\.610

Sam Berg: Sent to the student that way.

137

00:16:33\.200 \-\-\> 00:16:34\.089

Chad Dorsey: So it's like….

138

00:16:34\.510 \-\-\> 00:16:52\.089

Sam Berg: if it's… if… if that option exists in the platform, I think teachers are doing it there. If it doesn't, then they're doing it through a Schoology, or a Google Classroom, or a… I don't… I don't know what other LMSs we're using right now, but, that… that space.

139

00:16:52\.090 \-\-\> 00:17:03\.739

Chad Dorsey: What happens at grade time? Do I sit there with 3 laptops and translate across from all my platforms into a gradebook, or have I kept my gradebook on the side? What, you know, how do I deal with that?

140

00:17:04\.829 \-\-\> 00:17:06\.549

Brenda Tuohy: Rainbow goes into another platform.

141

00:17:06\.550 \-\-\> 00:17:17\.479

Chad Dorsey: Okay, but… and so I am, every night or every week, I'm sort of looking across what my students did that week, and saying, alright, they got 7 on this and 10 on that, and turning it into my gradebook.

142

00:17:17\.480 \-\-\> 00:17:25\.609

Sam Berg: Yeah, so I think there's a… there's another platform called Aries, which is where we take attendance, and that also has the grades in it.

143

00:17:25\.609 \-\-\> 00:17:27\.670

Chad Dorsey: That's SRS, right?

144

00:17:27\.670 \-\-\> 00:17:32\.860

Sam Berg: Yeah, that's the SIS. And so, then… teachers…

145

00:17:33\.160 \-\-\> 00:17:45\.819

Sam Berg: they have various ways. Some people have, like, a gradebook in Google Classroom, and then they just port that over. Some people are like, okay, now I'm going through and entering the grades in Aries as time goes on. …

146

00:17:46\.280 \-\-\> 00:17:57\.650

Sam Berg: I don't know, like, my kid is in middle school, I see his grades in Schoology. Each week, it sends me a thing that says, this is how he did in that. I don't know if that's linked.

147

00:17:57\.850 \-\-\> 00:18:07\.810

Sam Berg: to Aries, or if you have to, like, take those and then manually enter them into Aries? Like, I don't know how…

148

00:18:08\.120 \-\-\> 00:18:10\.540

Sam Berg: that interaction happens. …

149

00:18:11\.810 \-\-\> 00:18:19\.399

Sam Berg: with those… with… if… which platforms work together, which ones don't, and… and what… how complicated it is to get them to work together is, I think, another question.

150

00:18:23\.690 \-\-\> 00:18:42\.370

Chad Dorsey: if you were waving a magic wand about adoption or use of digital resources, or one that could reduce the things that you grumble about when you're, you know, closing the door at night, what would it be? What's the thing that you would try to take away or fix or change?

151

00:18:45\.010 \-\-\> 00:18:47\.829

Chad Dorsey: You can list more than one if you want.

152

00:18:52\.470 \-\-\> 00:18:56\.939

Sam Berg: I mean I… I think just…

153

00:18:57\.320 \-\-\> 00:19:02\.559

Sam Berg: More seamless integration would be a nice piece between platforms.

154

00:19:02\.690 \-\-\> 00:19:08\.930

Sam Berg: Like, I don't think Code.org interfaces with Aries. Like, that thing last year when we were trying to do the, …

155

00:19:09\.720 \-\-\> 00:19:15\.320

Sam Berg: they're saving stuff in Kodak. We're doing some LEGO projects right now, and…

156

00:19:15\.510 \-\-\> 00:19:30\.419

Sam Berg: kids are gonna code, but then it's, like, we were thinking, like, how… what's it look like to be able to code… to save that, so you could come back to it the next day? It's not impossible, but it's, like, 4 steps, you know? And if you have a class of 30, and…

157

00:19:30\.870 \-\-\> 00:19:37\.329

Sam Berg: There's not just on how to do it, you know, like, it just… it just… it takes a while to get to that spot, …

158

00:19:37\.950 \-\-\> 00:19:41\.120

Sam Berg: And I think… I think there's that.

159

00:19:41\.770 \-\-\> 00:19:43\.709

Sam Berg: I think the other thing is…

160

00:19:45\.490 \-\-\> 00:19:51\.699

Sam Berg: Ease of use in terms of, like, getting feedback to students, …

161

00:19:52\.340 \-\-\> 00:19:54\.740

Sam Berg: How… how can you look at…

162

00:19:55\.150 \-\-\> 00:20:03\.770

Sam Berg: how can you look at examples of, like, what's happening and give a kid feedback, or how can students look at each other's work and give each other feedback? Like, what is that, like…

163

00:20:04\.000 \-\-\> 00:20:04\.900

Sam Berg: …

164

00:20:06\.150 \-\-\> 00:20:20\.860

Sam Berg: what does that look like? And then I also think… this is a question that… that's, like, where I sit, but there's teachers that probably have different pain points, and… and would probably give really different answers, so… I don't know, what's… what do you think, Brenda?

165

00:20:21\.900 \-\-\> 00:20:28\.949

Brenda Tuohy: I mean… So my kid just started public school, but she's in pre\-K. So, this could change.

166

00:20:28\.950 \-\-\> 00:20:30\.420

Chad Dorsey: That's funny. ….

167

00:20:30\.680 \-\-\> 00:20:36\.470

Brenda Tuohy: But from… as a former elementary teacher who spends a lot of time coaching middle and high school teachers.

168

00:20:37\.560 \-\-\> 00:20:40\.100

Brenda Tuohy: I think we're overly fixated on grades.

169

00:20:40\.670 \-\-\> 00:20:44\.790

Brenda Tuohy: And so, like, for me, I would be interested in…

170

00:20:45\.230 \-\-\> 00:20:48\.660

Brenda Tuohy: Like, technological tools that give teachers

171

00:20:49\.290 \-\-\> 00:20:51\.660

Brenda Tuohy: Kind of insight into what kids are doing.

172

00:20:51\.870 \-\-\> 00:20:57\.210

Brenda Tuohy: So, like, insights that will guide their instruction, rather than…

173

00:20:57\.520 \-\-\> 00:21:02\.550

Brenda Tuohy: kind of, like, completion and grades. Teachers are always like, but how do I grade this? I'm like, it doesn't matter, I don't care about their…

174

00:21:02\.680 \-\-\> 00:21:07\.760

Brenda Tuohy: what are they learning? What are they doing? So I'm thinking about, like, something like CODAP. I think it would be interesting…

175

00:21:10\.100 \-\-\> 00:21:20\.160

Brenda Tuohy: you know, if there was some kind of… I don't even know, I'm sure it's possible somehow, but some kind of summary of, like, you gave the kids a task, and these are the tools that they use, like, this is what…

176

00:21:21\.240 \-\-\> 00:21:28\.599

Brenda Tuohy: 24 out of 25 students played around with the different axis… axes. You know, a couple students looked at

177

00:21:28\.720 \-\-\> 00:21:40\.099

Brenda Tuohy: like, measure central tendency. A couple students kind of went in to figure out formulas, or just some kind of way to, like, at a glance, see how students are using it. So as a teacher.

178

00:21:41\.100 \-\-\> 00:21:43\.579

Brenda Tuohy: You have a little bit more information.

179

00:21:43\.920 \-\-\> 00:21:52\.000

Brenda Tuohy: than just what you notice walking around, like, that could be… I feel like that would be, like, a way that the technology could enhance the teaching and the learning.

180

00:21:53\.300 \-\-\> 00:21:54\.219

Sam Berg: would be interesting.

181

00:21:54\.730 \-\-\> 00:22:09\.600

Sam Berg: Makes me think the other thing… I have a kid that's an 8th grade and a kid that's a junior. As a parent, I don't know that this is a compelling feature for schools or teachers, but it would be interesting to be able to see, kind of, what they're doing. Like, is there a… is there a parent

182

00:22:09\.940 \-\-\> 00:22:11\.220

Sam Berg: Where he could be like, oh.

183

00:22:11\.370 \-\-\> 00:22:23\.030

Sam Berg: this is what your kid did today. Like, I don't need to get into the whole, like, the guts of everything, but, like, cool, like… and I'd be like, awesome, let me ask him a question about that when he comes home tonight, you know? Or, kind of see about that.

184

00:22:24\.460 \-\-\> 00:22:38\.250

Sam Berg: And I see things… like, I can sometimes see some stuff in Schoology, but it would be… it's hard to navigate that, and that's more of a Schoology issue, but if there was an easy way to, like, push a thing out, that might be an interesting… an interesting thing as well.

185

00:22:39\.140 \-\-\> 00:22:44\.849

Chad Dorsey: Right, so it sounds like both of those are, sort of the artifacts of learning in process and after. Sorry, Leslie.

186

00:22:44\.850 \-\-\> 00:22:59\.129

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): I… I just… I want to follow up on something I think I heard you say earlier. It seems like you're interested in peer\-to\-peer review, or, like, your students being able to collaborate, or… can you… can you say some more about that?

187

00:23:01\.480 \-\-\> 00:23:17\.490

Sam Berg: I think one of the things that often happens with technology is sometimes it's, like, one kid, one screen, and so where's that conversation piece happening? And you can do some things as a teacher where it's, you know, two kids on one computer, or looking at different,

188

00:23:18\.050 \-\-\> 00:23:34\.299

Sam Berg: looking, … there's some apps that… where it's like, let me show this kid's work on the board right now, without having to… like, we now use GoGuardian, and I think that offers that feature. It used to be the kid used to, like, have to come plug their computer into the… the…

189

00:23:34\.630 \-\-\> 00:23:36\.370

Sam Berg: Projector?

190

00:23:36\.370 \-\-\> 00:23:37\.519

Brenda Tuohy: Keep my cable, yep.

191

00:23:37\.520 \-\-\> 00:23:41\.910

Sam Berg: Yeah, so it's like… Like, those kind of things, …

192

00:23:42\.540 \-\-\> 00:23:46\.240

Sam Berg: where there's opportunity for a kid to say, like, this is what I did.

193

00:23:46\.440 \-\-\> 00:24:00\.989

Sam Berg: and have other kids have… be able to look at the thing, and then be able to talk about it. When we first did the data science unit, it was… it was, like, poor planning on our part, but there were some kids that had done this thing on Kodak.

194

00:24:01\.060 \-\-\> 00:24:15\.239

Sam Berg: and they were each talking about their thing, but nobody could see what they were talking about. It was one of the weirdest, most bizarre, and yet, I was like, these kids kind of tried to hang with the conversation, but they didn't give any context either. They were just like, this is what I… and it was like.

195

00:24:15\.760 \-\-\> 00:24:29\.110

Sam Berg: really funny about, kind of, like, what happened. Had… and that was before there was, like, an ability to, like, oh, let's flash that kid's graph up on the screen. Then let's have that… let's ask questions about… let's have that conversation about that. And I think they could do that now with GoGuardian,

196

00:24:29\.840 \-\-\> 00:24:40\.799

Sam Berg: These were not Chromebooks, we couldn't even do the HDMI cable, so it was like, we're really stuck in figuring out how to help kids have a thing that they could then have a larger conversation about.

197

00:24:42\.550 \-\-\> 00:25:00\.329

Chad Dorsey: Do you think teachers are ready to orchestrate that? Do you think there are things that would help them deal with that in real time? I mean, there's a whole other dimension of that, and maybe it's exactly what we've always done, but it's not entirely right in real time in the classroom. And what would help them? If so, what would help them?

198

00:25:01\.340 \-\-\> 00:25:19\.959

Sam Berg: I think it depends on the teacher. I think there's some that are very ready to lead those conversations and have those artifacts. I think we have some folks that are sort of uncomfortable having some of those conversations, and so… and then there's some folks that are a little more uncomfortable with the technology and what it would take to do that, so there's kind of three camps of that.

199

00:25:20\.220 \-\-\> 00:25:23\.179

Sam Berg: But it's also the sort of thing where I think if…

200

00:25:23\.480 \-\-\> 00:25:29\.680

Sam Berg: people were doing it, and it, you know, it's like, oh, I… I saw so\-and\-so do… I could probably do that, too. You know, like…

201

00:25:29\.960 \-\-\> 00:25:35\.810

Sam Berg: … It might seem somewhat intimidating to some folks in the beginning, but over time.

202

00:25:36\.000 \-\-\> 00:25:42\.510

Sam Berg: Or with some professional development, it's like, oh, okay, here's how… here's what this could look like, here's how this would happen in the classroom. Again, you know….

203

00:25:42\.510 \-\-\> 00:25:47\.469

Chad Dorsey: Those things spread like a meme. Sometimes students even say, hey, can I show it up on the….

204

00:25:47\.470 \-\-\> 00:25:47\.910

Sam Berg: Oh, no doubt.

205

00:25:48\.520 \-\-\> 00:25:51\.650

Sam Berg: what… how that would work, I think, is important.

206

00:25:51\.650 \-\-\> 00:25:52\.330

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Hmm.

207

00:25:55\.690 \-\-\> 00:25:56\.720

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): And…

208

00:25:57\.180 \-\-\> 00:26:06\.300

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): And it sounds like it's not just orchestrating the conversation effectively across technology tools, it's also, like, some kind of summative…

209

00:26:06\.690 \-\-\> 00:26:07\.990

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): feedback.

210

00:26:08\.270 \-\-\> 00:26:09\.320

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): moment.

211

00:26:10\.950 \-\-\> 00:26:15\.430

Chad Dorsey: for teachers, or parents, or students, or… Yeah, I mean….

212

00:26:15\.470 \-\-\> 00:26:18\.749

Sam Berg: I think there's a lot of things on that list.

213

00:26:19\.350 \-\-\> 00:26:30\.219

Sam Berg: All of those would be nice, like… you have to think about, like, what's possible, or, like, what makes the most sense for what you're trying to do, so, ….

214

00:26:30\.430 \-\-\> 00:26:43\.309

Chad Dorsey: So, I mean, if I were pulling something out to summarize a thread, you know, here, it feels like you're saying one kid, one screen is kind of like… like, not that.

215

00:26:43\.400 \-\-\> 00:26:52\.739

Chad Dorsey: You know, like, one, you know, one screen, multiple kids, or more than one kid, one screen, like, how do we use this thing together?

216

00:26:53\.780 \-\-\> 00:27:00\.630

Brenda Tuohy: And one thing that we found, I mean, like, one of our learning objectives in our data science unit was for students

217

00:27:01\.850 \-\-\> 00:27:10\.860

Brenda Tuohy: to understand that there's different ways to represent data visually, and that how you choose to represent data is going to tell a different story. And so.

218

00:27:10\.940 \-\-\> 00:27:23\.889

Brenda Tuohy: CODAP was such a great tool, because students would just kind of drag and drop and then look at it and think about, what is this, what is now, what does this show me, and does this make sense? And I feel like, for us, where we wanted to take it was then kind of, like, comparing different

219

00:27:24\.610 \-\-\> 00:27:26\.700

Brenda Tuohy: different visualizations.

220

00:27:27\.260 \-\-\> 00:27:36\.900

Brenda Tuohy: kind of side by side. And so the way we did that in our instructional sequence is we had the students do a thing, and then in the next lesson, you know, we had screenshots.

221

00:27:37\.440 \-\-\> 00:27:51\.130

Brenda Tuohy: of data visualizations that we had created, but I feel like in an ideal world, you'd be able to kind of do that real time with the kids. They're like, no, let's… let's look at them, because I think you actually really need to see the side\-by\-side view.

222

00:27:51\.130 \-\-\> 00:27:51\.510

Chad Dorsey: Hmm.

223

00:27:51\.510 \-\-\> 00:27:55\.749

Brenda Tuohy: So not just, like, looking at one, but to kind of see, like, how did different people approach

224

00:27:56\.080 \-\-\> 00:27:57\.550

Brenda Tuohy: the same question.

225

00:27:59\.240 \-\-\> 00:28:02\.420

Sam Berg: And that… having that visual that kids can…

226

00:28:02\.680 \-\-\> 00:28:18\.879

Sam Berg: like, we… sometimes we'd print stuff off and let them have that conversation, and that was… rich discussion happened there. Having it in the moment, where it's like, oh, I just worked on this thing for 20 minutes, and this is what I have, and oh, this… now I'm looking at this one. Okay, like, would be even richer and more interesting, I think, for…

227

00:28:19\.000 \-\-\> 00:28:23\.819

Sam Berg: For folks to be able to, get a chance to do….

228

00:28:26\.360 \-\-\> 00:28:41\.039

Chad Dorsey: That's really, intriguing. So, the other layer of the conversation, I feel like we're sort of already onto, that… that some portion of the high\-level

229

00:28:41\.040 \-\-\> 00:28:46\.700

Chad Dorsey: code app infrastructure thing that we had been talking about in the last proposal.

230

00:28:46\.700 \-\-\> 00:28:54\.160

Chad Dorsey: seems like it's resonating with this whole notion, like, if there were a dashboard, or if I could see what other people were seeing, or if I could share my little….

231

00:28:54\.160 \-\-\> 00:29:00\.890

Brenda Tuohy: with somebody else, or maybe a teacher had a lesson they could share with another… sounds like there's… they're still there in that idea.

232

00:29:01\.390 \-\-\> 00:29:02\.370

Sam Berg: 100%.

233

00:29:03\.580 \-\-\> 00:29:27\.639

Chad Dorsey: Yeah, that's definitely very interesting, and I think, you know, as we talk more about resubmission, we can think about that, but it may be that there are other opportunities as well. I mean, we're… we are trying to think about different ways to bring forward some of the common strengths that we're hearing, and, you know, it's… you're not the only people thinking about collaborating around artifacts on computers, and we have some technologies that might make that possible.

234

00:29:27\.640 \-\-\> 00:29:34\.460

Chad Dorsey: So I think there might be something there, and maybe there are people outside of NSF who'd be willing to fund that, too, so it might be very interesting.

235

00:29:34\.550 \-\-\> 00:29:49\.090

Chad Dorsey: to play that out, especially given that you… so how many classrooms are using the curriculum that you've got right now? What's the status of that? Is it waning, staying steady, you know, growing? Are you forgotten about it because you're on to 7 other things?

236

00:29:50\.180 \-\-\> 00:29:52\.030

Sam Berg: Still doing it, ….

237

00:29:52\.030 \-\-\> 00:29:52\.690

Chad Dorsey: That's something?

238

00:29:52\.690 \-\-\> 00:29:55\.329

Sam Berg: So, we're still doing it across middle school, ….

239

00:29:55\.330 \-\-\> 00:29:57\.259

Chad Dorsey: And how many teachers does that mean?

240

00:29:57\.260 \-\-\> 00:30:03\.390

Sam Berg: So we had… what did we have last year? 9? 8? I think? …

241

00:30:03\.630 \-\-\> 00:30:10\.229

Sam Berg: Various levels of, you know, like, fidelity is a… is a… is always a tricky thing around here, but, like.

242

00:30:10\.900 \-\-\> 00:30:15\.640

Sam Berg: Yeah, people jumped in and did some stuff, which is….

243

00:30:15\.640 \-\-\> 00:30:22\.070

Chad Dorsey: And when they do it, are they doing it in science? Is it across computer science? Computer science. Computer science.

244

00:30:22\.070 \-\-\> 00:30:26\.130

Sam Berg: Yeah, we have computer science class. I think the… one of the things…

245

00:30:26\.380 \-\-\> 00:30:31\.240

Sam Berg: We've thought about and haven't figured out is This is a cool tool.

246

00:30:31\.350 \-\-\> 00:30:38\.029

Sam Berg: how do we help other folks in other classes know about it, and that they could use it? And….

247

00:30:38\.030 \-\-\> 00:30:44\.390

Brenda Tuohy: A lot of the work that we wanted to do with the DRK12 proposal is to kind of, like, bring this across the curriculum.

248

00:30:45\.420 \-\-\> 00:30:49\.359

Brenda Tuohy: Because we actually feel like, you know, the computer science makes sense to have a discrete

249

00:30:49\.660 \-\-\> 00:30:58\.010

Brenda Tuohy: unit of study where you're learning specifically about data science, but all the practice and the application, I feel like it's not… it's gonna be… is gonna happen outside of…

250

00:30:58\.210 \-\-\> 00:30:59\.569

Brenda Tuohy: Computer science.

251

00:30:59\.670 \-\-\> 00:31:02\.979

Brenda Tuohy: I think science is the most obvious place.

252

00:31:04\.600 \-\-\> 00:31:14\.090

Chad Dorsey: Yeah, it is, and it also isn't once you start to think about it. We've done some really interesting things in middle school social studies, for example, and….

253

00:31:14\.090 \-\-\> 00:31:14\.600

Brenda Tuohy: I mean….

254

00:31:14\.600 \-\-\> 00:31:23\.459

Chad Dorsey: It takes a minute for the teacher to get over, maybe depending upon the teacher, over that, you know, concern, but if you pair them with somebody, you give them a little bit, or you give them an hour.

255

00:31:23\.460 \-\-\> 00:31:35\.759

Chad Dorsey: they get… I mean, they get the relevance, right? I mean, immigration data and social studies class is, like, no\-brainer, right? And so, all of a sudden, you're into really interesting conversations with kids, and then teachers lean in from there.

256

00:31:35\.990 \-\-\> 00:31:39\.609

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah, I think the other place that we've talked about, …

257

00:31:40\.040 \-\-\> 00:31:41\.899

Brenda Tuohy: Where there's a lot of potential.

258

00:31:43\.320 \-\-\> 00:31:47\.850

Brenda Tuohy: Is, our high school… our high school seniors have a,

259

00:31:48\.300 \-\-\> 00:31:55\.320

Brenda Tuohy: Capstone project graduation requirements, like a big summative project where the students do research and, …

260

00:31:57\.390 \-\-\> 00:32:02\.639

Brenda Tuohy: as STEM people, every year, that's the time of year that Sam and I complain about, like, the lack of data literacy.

261

00:32:03\.670 \-\-\> 00:32:10\.160

Brenda Tuohy: The kids will be like, I did a survey, I asked 8 people, here's my graph, it's the pre\-populated thing from Google Forms. Like, come on.

262

00:32:10\.160 \-\-\> 00:32:12\.530

Sam Berg: It's gonna do so much more!

263

00:32:12\.530 \-\-\> 00:32:14\.420

Chad Dorsey: Right, exactly, right.

264

00:32:14\.420 \-\-\> 00:32:20\.460

Sam Berg: We actually think, I was like, man, if we could do some of those data science lessons, one, to show the tool, and two, to think about, like.

265

00:32:20\.730 \-\-\> 00:32:33\.799

Sam Berg: sample size and, and, all the sort of, like, basic data literacy kind of stuff, it would be super powerful in that high school capstone class. It would make things make…

266

00:32:34\.540 \-\-\> 00:32:37\.760

Sam Berg: way better… The project would be way better.

267

00:32:37\.760 \-\-\> 00:32:38\.400

Chad Dorsey: Yeah.

268

00:32:38\.400 \-\-\> 00:32:45\.519

Brenda Tuohy: And a lot of the teachers are humanities teachers, which I think is part of why there's a lot of, kind of, like, fear of.

269

00:32:47\.430 \-\-\> 00:32:48\.040

Chad Dorsey: The technology.

270

00:32:48\.740 \-\-\> 00:32:50\.300

Chad Dorsey: Right. …

271

00:32:51\.150 \-\-\> 00:32:55\.090

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah, but there's an opportunity. There's… well, there is a need that we have identified.

272

00:32:55\.730 \-\-\> 00:32:56\.610

Brenda Tuohy: as well.

273

00:32:56\.630 \-\-\> 00:32:57\.580

Chad Dorsey: That's….

274

00:32:58\.340 \-\-\> 00:33:11\.389

Sam Berg: your platform, the Kodat platform, feels like a gateway into that space. Like, it's easy enough, you just drag the sheet over, or you just upload the sheet, and then you just pull the… like.

275

00:33:11\.660 \-\-\> 00:33:13\.360

Sam Berg: That's usable for…

276

00:33:13\.670 \-\-\> 00:33:19\.560

Sam Berg: a humanities teacher. You don't have to know R, you don't have to even get into formulas in Sheets or Excel, like.

277

00:33:19\.690 \-\-\> 00:33:34\.909

Sam Berg: there's a real opportunity there. Our… one of our struggles is, like, how do we get that in front of people? Because we don't interface with that group as much or at all, and so, we're trying to figure out, like, what that would…

278

00:33:35\.060 \-\-\> 00:33:36\.070

Sam Berg: What that would look like.

279

00:33:36\.430 \-\-\> 00:33:54\.839

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Yeah, I'm fascinated to hear, like, you have a dedicated computer science curriculum. That's interesting, not everybody does. I also heard you say the word Brenda Engineering, right? Like, so maybe there are classes with that title on them? Are you not….

280

00:33:54\.840 \-\-\> 00:33:55\.910

Brenda Tuohy: fall, yes.

281

00:33:56\.110 \-\-\> 00:34:03\.190

Leslie Bondaryk (she/her): Yeah, so you're not required to, like, jam this into… Biology, or something.

282

00:34:04\.550 \-\-\> 00:34:05\.479

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah, I mean…

283

00:34:06\.140 \-\-\> 00:34:17\.659

Brenda Tuohy: So Sam, like, Sam's job is funded by Salesforce, which is here in the Bay Area, and they also fund the salaries of our middle school computer science teachers. So part of our unique situation is that

284

00:34:17\.909 \-\-\> 00:34:27\.449

Brenda Tuohy: we have computer science teachers in all of our middle schools, because of that. My funding for my job comes through,

285

00:34:27\.770 \-\-\> 00:34:30\.360

Brenda Tuohy: like, career development? CTE.

286

00:34:31\.199 \-\-\> 00:34:32\.429

Brenda Tuohy: …

287

00:34:32\.550 \-\-\> 00:34:38\.800

Brenda Tuohy: I used to have a job supporting science teachers, but there's not funding for core science teachers the way there is for

288

00:34:38\.860 \-\-\> 00:34:54\.640

Brenda Tuohy: career and technical education, so I work with a very small handful of engineering and computer science teachers, instead of the hundreds of science teachers who would love to have more support. So that's… that's just part of the context that we're in. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for our teachers to innovate.

289

00:34:54\.659 \-\-\> 00:35:02\.519

Brenda Tuohy: And when we think about getting, kind of, like, back into the mainstream, like, of all the core academic classes, that's why we look for things like

290

00:35:02\.970 \-\-\> 00:35:04\.989

Brenda Tuohy: Grants that can fund that work.

291

00:35:05\.380 \-\-\> 00:35:25\.329

Chad Dorsey: Yeah, I was interested in the Salesforce connection because I ran into some Salesforce people at the Anaheim conference a while back. That's been there for a long time, but the CS piece, in terms of the teacher funding, it's been a handful of years, 3, 4, 5 years. Did they fund curriculum as well, or what's the history on that?

292

00:35:25\.330 \-\-\> 00:35:26\.659

Sam Berg: 10 years now?

293

00:35:26\.660 \-\-\> 00:35:33\.230

Chad Dorsey: And always, always the same, sort of, we're gonna fund teacher positions, period, or is it very in terms of what they fund?

294

00:35:33\.230 \-\-\> 00:35:34\.910

Sam Berg: We… we've…

295

00:35:35\.860 \-\-\> 00:35:49\.290

Sam Berg: Yeah, we've always had it be… they don't want to buy stuff. They don't want to buy computers, they don't want to buy desks, they don't want to buy furniture, they don't want to buy books. They want to fund people and professional development, and so that has been… it pays my salary, we've paid…

296

00:35:49\.400 \-\-\> 00:35:59\.269

Sam Berg: as much FTE as we… we get the amount, and then we figure out how much FTE we can offer to the school. The school pays the other part. We pay for professional development. We haven't…

297

00:35:59\.640 \-\-\> 00:36:05\.080

Sam Berg: We've never purchased curriculum, just because Crow.org has been free, and we felt like

298

00:36:05\.310 \-\-\> 00:36:09\.049

Sam Berg: for a long time, that was the best one out there. We couldn't see a reason to…

299

00:36:09\.360 \-\-\> 00:36:12\.909

Sam Berg: To pay money for the other options, ….

300

00:36:12\.940 \-\-\> 00:36:23\.819

Chad Dorsey: And they weren't involved in saying, we want to build this new curriculum, we're going to pay for time, or something for that. They were… we've got this other opportunity to teach it, we've got… they're paying for the people to teach it.

301

00:36:23\.820 \-\-\> 00:36:38\.079

Sam Berg: Yes, no, they did… they weren't… they were not… it… it was never a, we're gonna build, we're gonna build a curriculum, or we're gonna build, a platform, or any of that. It was… it was… it was, how do we get kids learning computer science?

302

00:36:38\.620 \-\-\> 00:36:46\.059

Chad Dorsey: Do you have consistent PD still? How much… how much time does that take up, or how much time is supported in what times of the year?

303

00:36:46\.940 \-\-\> 00:36:53\.130

Sam Berg: We… we offer a summer… some summer PD every summer, …

304

00:36:53\.670 \-\-\> 00:37:01\.720

Sam Berg: We offer PD the second Wednesday of each month. We've been doing that, and both of those, more recently, have been in,

305

00:37:02\.390 \-\-\> 00:37:15\.290

Sam Berg: with other STEM teachers, so science teachers have been a part of that. Some of our other CTE teachers, health teachers, have been a part of that. We have a couple times a year where we have dedicated,

306

00:37:15\.560 \-\-\> 00:37:29\.070

Sam Berg: computer science release days, so we pull people out and get more into, like, the computer science part. The STEM PDs have been more focused on pedagogy, like, how to get kids talking to each other? What are the language routines that would help with conversation?

307

00:37:29\.700 \-\-\> 00:37:38\.400

Chad Dorsey: Do you all… do you both design those? Is that all internal? Do you bring any external resources in for PD? It's just… it's people's time and internal.

308

00:37:38\.400 \-\-\> 00:37:41\.859

Sam Berg: It's us, mostly.

309

00:37:42\.320 \-\-\> 00:37:54\.720

Sam Berg: Yeah, every once in a while. We've… the other thing we've done, like, when we do something like the data science thing, where we developed a curriculum, or we've developed something, we're working on an AI unit, like, we've used WestEd as a… as a partner, and have Yvonne

310

00:37:55\.500 \-\-\> 00:38:01\.740

Sam Berg: Just be, like, in thought partnership with us, and also to help evaluate how it's going.

311

00:38:03\.180 \-\-\> 00:38:04\.289

Chad Dorsey: That's really useful.

312

00:38:05\.240 \-\-\> 00:38:08\.700

Chad Dorsey: This is great. What did we not ask that we should have?

313

00:38:13\.640 \-\-\> 00:38:19\.419

Sam Berg: I mean, I think it kind of depends on where you're going, like, what… you know, like, I don't know what's your…

314

00:38:19\.540 \-\-\> 00:38:22\.209

Sam Berg: what you're getting to. It feels like….

315

00:38:22\.210 \-\-\> 00:38:25\.130

Chad Dorsey: We're not totally sure either, we're really just trying to understand.

316

00:38:25\.130 \-\-\> 00:38:32\.189

Sam Berg: So, you know, like, you know our pain points, you kind of know what… what we're… what the things that we're excited by. I think then the next is, like, …

317

00:38:33\.090 \-\-\> 00:38:47\.360

Sam Berg: So I don't know if there was anything that stood out to me. I don't know about for you, Brenda. I think one thing is if you get noodling along with something, and you're like, what about this? You know, feel free to give a call, and we could say, like, oh, okay, like, we could run that past some teachers, or we could give our…

318

00:38:47\.360 \-\-\> 00:38:53\.970

Sam Berg: 2 cents for whatever that's worth on the thing, as you… if you got farther down the road.

319

00:38:55\.760 \-\-\> 00:39:02\.610

Chad Dorsey: Is there anybody else we should be talking to inside the district, outside the district, in some other states who….

320

00:39:03\.950 \-\-\> 00:39:19\.770

Brenda Tuohy: I mean, I think if you have, like, if you… if you want to get more in\-depth about, like, integration with Clever or other, you know, I can connect you with the guy in Oakland who does that. If you want to talk more about, you know, high school science curriculum, we can connect you with that person. Like, it kind of depends. Yep.

321

00:39:19\.770 \-\-\> 00:39:24\.070

Chad Dorsey: That's great, yeah, I don't have a specific ask there, just sort of wondering.

322

00:39:24\.070 \-\-\> 00:39:24\.800

Sam Berg: Yeah.

323

00:39:25\.990 \-\-\> 00:39:32\.410

Chad Dorsey: So, in terms of, open loops here, I think, you know, one… one is,

324

00:39:32\.410 \-\-\> 00:39:57\.400

Chad Dorsey: A, this is really useful, and you know, it may seem like just everyday stuff for you, but that's what actually we're interested in now, is getting that picture. B, I think we've opened up some really… some interesting things that might have resonance with ideas that we've been ginning up, and… and so we may want to come back and ask about those, or maybe there's some, you know, opportunity to fund something together independently with a, you know, foundation, or who knows what would be happy to

325

00:39:57\.400 \-\-\> 00:40:06\.149

Chad Dorsey: to come back with if we get a glimpse of that. And I think C, and probably a D and an E, I'm forgetting, but,

326

00:40:06\.170 \-\-\> 00:40:29\.929

Chad Dorsey: I think you're onto something, Brenda, when you're saying, like, how could we deal with the capstone courses, or you were mentioning the same, get this in front of them. Just earlier this week, I was talking to another PI, and she has an actually pretty nice, you know, interdisciplinary CS curriculum that uses Code App, too, or, so that might be interesting. But she would… we were saying, like, what about, like, Data Fridays?

327

00:40:29\.930 \-\-\> 00:40:45\.299

Chad Dorsey: Or something like that. Like, is there some way of having, like, 45\-minute thing that I can just pull down and use? Because God knows Fridays are Fridays. But that might be just enough, because it doesn't take much, right? I mean, you sort of get that whiff of credit, and you're like, oh, wait.

328

00:40:45\.420 \-\-\> 00:40:49\.379

Chad Dorsey: I could do this, and… but it's getting it in front of them, I think you're right.

329

00:40:49\.380 \-\-\> 00:40:50\.450

Brenda Tuohy: Yeah, yeah.

330

00:40:51\.080 \-\-\> 00:41:00\.640

Sam Berg: And I think the other thing for that piece, especially if we're thinking about humanities teachers, is what is… day to Fridays, but they're gonna need some support in, like… Exactly.

331

00:41:00\.640 \-\-\> 00:41:03\.739

Chad Dorsey: Exactly. Like, how to get that off the ground, like, what is….

332

00:41:03\.740 \-\-\> 00:41:06\.680

Sam Berg: What does it look like? What are some… what are some conversations to have?

333

00:41:06\.830 \-\-\> 00:41:08\.120

Chad Dorsey: But, ….

334

00:41:08\.880 \-\-\> 00:41:20\.590

Sam Berg: And I think the other thing that might be interesting in that is you guys have, some of the data sets, like the… when I go to Code App, there's the rollercoaster one, there's some of the ones that exist in there. I don't know if there's…

335

00:41:21\.200 \-\-\> 00:41:22\.950

Sam Berg: A bigger library, or, you know, like.

336

00:41:22\.950 \-\-\> 00:41:45\.560

Chad Dorsey: Yeah, so I think there are two things. So, yes, we're starting to think about that, you know, it's always a pain point, and hidden inside the plugins menu are data choosers. You can get all of the American Community Survey data, you can get subsets of that with just a push of a button, so there are really interesting questions you can ask with those for humanities, sometimes to census data and things like that, so….
