Transcript:

Me: Welcome. What's the what's the status of of the world right now for you?

Them: A little bit of brain fog all the time now.

Me: I I'm sure that's true.

Them: But, yeah, I think we're oh, Paul Horowitz just arrived.

Me: Well, that's good. Well, the world just got brighter.

Them: Been. I thought I was the only one here today. We have almost everything in place except for the narrative.

Me: Okay.

Them: We have a lot of text

Me: Okay.

Them: in the documents.

Me: That's a start.

Them: Working on more.

Me: It's necessary, but not sufficient, I think, is the raise there. Right?

Them: Hoping Right. I you know, I think I think that by this evening, we'll have a draft. That's a little bit more than a rough draft, but it's still gonna need significant

Me: Mhmm.

Them: shaping. So but I think I think, you know, we're shooting for Wednesday afternoon. I think we're gonna make it.

Me: K.

Them: But it will depend on how much like, when I finally read through it, my sections and Nam Sue's sections actually

Me: Mhmm.

Them: are are talking about the same proposal.

Me: Right. Exactly. Are you writing them separately and then coming together? Or

Them: You know? Well, we we've been chatting quite a bit. About trying to make sure we're on the same page. But sometimes she kinda go off on a tangent. And she's like, well, I thought we were doing one model

Me: Oh, yeah. Right?

Them: across all kinds of all all disciplines. And I was like, no. We're doing different models in different disciplines.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: You know, that kind of a

Me: Yeah. Those are those are fun, especially when they turn into, you know, project, you know, table reworkings or, you know, I just made the diagram for the seven by one, and now you made it one by nine or yeah.

Them: So so, anyway, that's happening. Cynthia is actually gonna work on the

Me: Okay.

Them: timeline, so I don't know. To work on that.

Me: Great. Awesome.

Them: We probably, you know, will make some kind of theory of action little diagram. And hope that it all fits in there. You know, it's a bit weird writing for

Me: Right. Program call. Yeah.

Them: space. Like, you know, I'm writing

Me: And precise.

Them: all this we're writing all this academic stuff, and I'm not sure they care that much about it.

Me: Right.

Them: So

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: I, you know, I only really know how to write for all the other things that are in DRL.

Me: Uh\-huh. Yeah.

Them: Anyway, so we'll see. But think you know, I think the the general form, I'm using the same you know, importance, goals, theoretical framing, active action, research, you know, research

Me: Mhmm.

Them: development plan, research plan, and disseminate you know, evaluation dissemination and broader impacts.

Me: Right.

Them: So I do think that one of the things that may be difficult and maybe maybe you could help with this, is the how to write the broader impacts.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So we're working in Alabama. But do we highlight that we're working in sort of urban suburban part of Alabama. That, you know, a large number of the students are African American. I mean, do I highlight that, or do I make sure not to highlight that? Do I

Me: Yeah.

Them: how do I say what we're doing is gonna be broadly applicable to everyone?

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: Because we've chosen this location. I got you know, that question I had before about

Me: Right.

Them: the the the PAPPG still says broader impacts is such and such in the the webinar for this proposal had you know, that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: bullet of broadening participation in the seminar.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know, they they they clearly avoided it

Me: Right.

Them: in this one. That we just saw, and it's not in the it's it's sort of removed from the RFP. It's like have they just not scrubbed all the RFPs enough to

Me: Right.

Them: anyway, I'm just I don't know how to say we're working in this place We're going to be working with students who maybe have not been particularly prominent in the tech workforce and it can be applicable to everyone everywhere.

Me: Yeah. I mean, I think it's, you know, and I think it's as much the latter as anything. You know, the the we are ensuring that this you know, that the work that we're doing, that the the, you know, impacts of we're doing are available to everyone and available to and appropriate for everyone. Or something like that. You know, the

Them: This is

Me: the fallback phrase from Lindsey Henderson in Utah is still very useful. I think it turned into a philosophy in the ease of she said, what has worked for her for years in Utah, a very red state, is opportunity for all, especially those farthest from it. Is the way she's framed things. And, you know, she said that's been successful sort of, you know, on a regular basis. And so trying to say, you know, this provides opportunity for everyone you know, and framing it in ways with opportunities that are currently missed by our system, by our society, by our education or whatever, and then making sure that it's available for everyone and especially available for those who might be farthest from those opportunities currently or something like that. Without needing to say more. I'm sure there are ways to

Them: Okay.

Me: frame it.

Them: Yeah. I mean, one of the things I could

Me: I mean, broad broader impacts at its base Like, yes, it does say underserved, what have you, but and, also, also, the sort of base level broader impacts is like, this good for society? Essentially? Right? I mean,

Them: Right. The

Me: difference with people.

Them: all those pieces. There's one part of the proposal in the in the importance of the framing where I said one of the reasons we're working early in third grade is it's prior to social pressures for for various groups to drop out of

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: comp computer stuff. So we're reaching everybody by going into third grade.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That might be I mean, maybe not highlighting the location and where working at all.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But it's an EPSCoR state.

Me: I mean, it's not supposed I mean, there's a there's a socioeconomic and educational I mean, in Alabama, like, it's the socioeconomic and educational gaps are stunning. So, it's kind of hard to not highlight those. And I mean, they're they are disproportionately, you know, black because of the population. That doesn't change the fact that it's just like there's an education opportunity here that is almost unequaled. In Alabama. I mean, I've got an Alabama proposal you can

Them: Oh, that might be helpful.

Me: look at as well in case that was useful. It was not as successful proposal, but but that was mostly because we had too many partners. So let's see that as

Them: Yeah. That might be helpful. The other thing I was trying to figure out is, like, well, this is you know, geographically, it's the Deep South.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Do we mention that? Is that a part of the broader impact? You know, we're I know.

Me: Let's see. So put in Slack.

Them: Yeah. I need to look at all of the components of broader impact and focus on how can I talk about the various bullets in maybe not the expanding or whatever? But alright. I will take a look at that and see if there's anything that I can you know, use to inform how I wanna frame the broader impact.

Me: Yeah. It's definitely got stats and things in there. That was iTest and the old iTest. So it was you know, it leans a lot on some of the things that are not useful anymore, but But in general, like look at your bottom four and Alabama's there, You know, pretty much any stat you want for education. So that's still the truth.

Them: K. Yeah. They I did get feedback from the program officer on the one pager, which had a broader impacts part. He said Where's that? Oh, on the broader impacts question, I think the high level description you have there sounds reasonable. Parenthesis, though panelists may want to hear a little bit about how you'll work toward slash assess scalability and replicability. And then what we wrote in the broader impacts I wrote anchored in an EPSCoR Alabama. This project contributes to broadening participation in computer education for underserved communities in the Deep South. By equipping local educators and students with free web based modeling centered compute computational tools we aim to establish a scalable model that can be replicated offering early on computational literacy to traditionally underrepresented population. So he didn't push back against that.

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: I wrote it that way because I wanted to see how they respond. But I also get the feeling the fact that they didn't answer my

Me: Right. I mean,

Them: is that they're afraid to respond.

Me: say I don't know how much they're gonna say in email about this. Yeah.

Them: Right.

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: So I don't know.

Me: Yeah. I mean, I think you I think you could just say that there are, you know, there's been a you know, an opportunity gap in Alabama that's clearly, you know, clearly illustrated by the studies in the something, whatever, and, you know, this is gonna bring opportunity to to all, you know, people in Alabama and and by so know, anything you do in Alabama is addressing the broadening participation in The United States. So you might be able to get that. That piece in there as well. Scalability is a different question, but

Them: See. Yeah. So opportunity gap in Alabama. So it's good that we're there.

Me: Yeah.

Them: But what we developed there will be applicable everywhere. K.

Me: Certainly. You can make it there. You can make it anywhere.

Them: The other question I had from you was about tomorrow's proposal

Me: Mhmm.

Them: meeting. What the agenda is. I obviously want to be there, but I this it's it's a big chunk of the day.

Me: Right. Yeah. I know. I think you I think having your head there for at least, you know, parts of it is gonna be important for others and hopefully for you as well. I'm putting the agenda together this afternoon, I I can send you send you tips on you know, if you had to choose an hour or or so within that, when would be the best? Case that makes a difference for your timing. But

Them: I will find I mean, depending on how much gets done, I will try and

Me: yeah. But Yep. Yeah. Under understood.

Them: whole thing. But okay. That's about it. That's all I had

Me: Okay. That's great. I will take up your head until we get farther along as soon as you're

Them: mean, I am

Me: done with that. Obviously, we should be thinking about not just these other proposals, but about supplementals, which I you know, I need to talk to Jay about that as well. I haven't gotten to loop back with her on supplementals.

Them: Yeah. We talked about it in the meeting. Just before this. And data by voice. The the annual report was just approved.

Me: Good.

Them: So it's sort of on Leila's mind. It's Leila Lyons.

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: And and so I said after I get this done, if we get this in on Wednesday, hopefully, I

Me: Mhmm.

Them: can have, like, a one pager by Friday. And then we'll send that to her. And move try moving that forward. The framing being we we believe we have a prototype. That's working. We believe that within twelve months, it will be actually ready for a classroom and that the benefits from this approach go beyond our initial you know,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: target audience of blind and low vision and so it would make sense to try this and regular classroom. That's

Me: Yeah.

Them: that's our

Me: Yeah. I think that's straightforward cell. Basically we're trying to to not be exclusive to one group but we're trying to bring this to everybody and the supplemental can do that.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Cool. Yeah. That makes sense.

Them: Okay.

Me: Alright. Very good. I'll send you some stuff and see you tomorrow at some point. And let me know if I can be helpful as you're writing or thinking or whatever in Alright.

Them: Alright. Well, thank you. You bye.

Me: Very good. Bye.
