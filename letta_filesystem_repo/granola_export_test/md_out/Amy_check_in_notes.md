Transcript:

Me: PIN.

Them: You know, it was both hard and lovely. I moved my mom to assisted living.

Me: Right. Yes.

Them: Beforehand, and you know, it was a little bit of a transition. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard being old.

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: But it was also just a perfect beach week, so that was, you know,

Me: That's good, I guess.

Them: So I got a lot of swimming, and my knee held up. So I felt really

Me: That's something. K.

Them: grateful. Yes. Yeah.

Me: Uh\-huh. Yeah.

Them: Yeah. So I'm hard it's hard to be back, as you can imagine.

Me: Yeah. No. I I feel like I've been back for a week and some, and it still feels like that. So, yeah, I got it.

Them: Yeah. Well and this is just a quick meeting because I know we're meeting

Me: Yeah,

Them: tomorrow. So, you know, way back before we met with Stephanie, I sent her this, like, big winding email.

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: You know? Like, and one of the things was, let's see.

Me: STA. When is that?

Them: I asked if she was attending the conferences, and would you be willing partner with us to help us do a cocktail, a lunch, a breakfast type focus group with attendees?

Me: Right. Uh\-huh.

Them: Helping us to get teachers to attend and perhaps taking talking about your work with CC. While there. So so that's what you know, like, that was a general thing. And then she sent the email. That she reached out to the KST president

Me: Right.

Them: I am thinking this may be a breakfast event as I know they have luncheon cocktail reception that's already been supported by other groups. So what type of numbers are we thinking? Wondering about a breakfast event.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Etcetera. So that's what she was asking.

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: So one of the questions I have is you know, are we interested in traveling? What does the focus group entail?

Me: Right.

Them: And is this something you know, like, it's she has

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: the in to get people, I suspect, but who not? Right? And, I wasn't around to hear how things went at

Me: Well, we're talking about that tomorrow. We didn't

Them: okay.

Me: really debrief besides online and, you know, part of that part of the conversation I mean, the main the main thing to be, you digging into tomorrow is, like, okay. We've done this once. You know? What do we what have we learned What does that mean? We wanna ask differently or focusing on more or what have you in the next you know, time, and we've got a couple of these locally. If we have this one that's, you know, gotten three years so of these that we could be doing, what does that mean for us? What do we what do we need to know?

Them: Okay. So what I can do is I can just drop a line to Stephanie I mean, she got the I you know, I was away on vacation

Me: Sure.

Them: message so I can say, you know, I'm just back, and I'll be checking in with you all tomorrow. And then we can decide about her pursuing this. And then if so, what? You know? Because you know, it's a good opportunity. It's obviously not

Me: Yep. I think it's a I think it's a good opportunity, I think

Them: only opportunity. We just I I just think it's interesting to happen.

Me: it's well timed. You know, I think the I think the only, you know, well, one of the questions for her and to to weigh is that know, I think one of the things we know so far is that, you know, the size matters and 45 people is not gonna be useful unless we sent three people down and broke them up into three rooms, which wouldn't be so it's more does 15 people work for them in some way, shape, or form, does that mean we're talking about something different you know, or not? Or fine. We just need a smaller room. You know, like, I think

Them: Okay.

Me: that's that's the first question I'd have for

Them: Alright. So so why don't we tomorrow, like, come up with what our goal is and

Me: I think so. Yep.

Them: and, you know, and then I can relay that. Like, if it is that one of us is gonna go down and just, like, conduct this focus group over breakfast,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and this is how many people we need. You know? Or you know, then then then we can commit to that, and one of us will do that.

Me: Yep. Yeah. I think I think that's the I think that's the right way to

Them: No.

Me: frame it for ourselves and and for her.

Them: Okay.

Me: Okay.

Them: Alright. So that yeah. I mean, I was all like, oh, there's no meeting tomorrow. Now I see there's a

Me: I know. I know. Well, I added it because, you know, I took it off and a couple weeks, and I've got, you know, kid appointments and things, and then I realized that, you know, there was actually space on the calendar, so it's my bad, but I stuck it back on.

Them: Okay.

Me: Made it virtual so that we don't have people trying to change their plans who had already planned to be at home. But I think it fits for everybody, including Jay's kid scheduling. So let's make it happen.

Them: Okay.

Me: Alright.

Them: Alright. So that

Me: Yep. We definitely will. That's

Them: let's make sure we get that on the agenda so that we can apply for that tomorrow.

Me: that's the main thing we're talking about is debriefing what we've done so far and thinking about what that means for next versions of this kind of thing. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. Good.

Me: Excellent. Alright. I'll

Them: Alright. How'd it go with Foundation?

Me: fine. We're, you know, we're it's not a foundation conversation as much as, you know, working together conversation with them by the you know, we're on prototypes and ideas and examples, you know, with them, but it's still early

Them: Oh,

Me: you know, early stage. They're putting together examples of what might work, and we're saying, alright. We can hack that simulation to fit in your, you know, things so that you could start to see whether it would work with this house design unit that you're making or whatever And we hear what you're asking, but that would take us five days, and that's beyond the scope of this first pass. But, you know, we'd love to spend five days working on that thing. If you get excited about it or what have you,

Them: Right. Right. Right.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Okay.

Me: But they they are they are working with somebody who has a lot of money and is not spending a lot of money on quite yet. So and and may not be ever entirely We'll see. But they're doing interesting things. So

Them: Good. Alright. Sounds good.

Me: alright.

Them: See you tomorrow.

Me: Good. I will see you tomorrow. Welcome back. Bye.
