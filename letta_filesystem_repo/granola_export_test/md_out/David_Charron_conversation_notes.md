\- Program confirmed continuing with funding still available

\- Phase 2 applications face unclear review process

\- All previous program officers departed

\- Need to identify current reviewers through NSF probing

\- Relationship building crucial for success

\- Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition insights

\- Not much segmentation between phases \- definitions should be clearer

\- Focus on strong execution\-oriented application

\- Must demonstrate genuine need for funding

\- Organizational structure within Concord acceptable

\- No need for separate 501©(3\) or LLC

\- Consider overhead rate implications for grant application

\- Can frame as “center” within existing organization

\- Community management parallels social network model

\- Small core contributors, larger passive user base

\- Management approaches vary: tight maintainer committees vs loose Discord affiliations

\- Challenge identifying non\-members who should be engaged

\#\#\# Funding Landscape and Strategic Pivot

\- Competition intensifying across all alternative funding sources

\- Baker Fellows at Berkeley: applications tripled in recent round

\- Many organizations diversifying from NSF dependency

\- Philanthropic funding requires different approach

\- Panelists were traditional “customers” under NSF model

Transcript:

Me: Hello, David. How are doing?

Them: Hi, Chad. I'm good.

Me: That's

Them: Are you?

Me: I'm doing well. How was your summer? Is your summer a time of busyness or less so, or it's all the same these days?

Them: It is it has been a very busy summer. I've had a number of classes going on, and it just hasn't really slowed down at all. So

Me: You is that the primary thing you do is teaching in how many classes? What's your load

Them: yeah,

Me: these days?

Them: It's hard to to recognize the load so I can just go back and tell you, you know,

Me: Yeah.

Them: I just did an a class for executive MBAs here at Berkeley called applied innovation. Before that, I had a group from the Technical University of Munich in town for a week. Before that, I had a group from City University of China. Before that, was running another program, which I can't remember. And it's just been a constant

Me: So it's not, but it's

Them: constant drum. But

Me: not, you know, scheduled classes of students per as much as it is sort of consulting organized in your professional development ish. Mhmm.

Them: Yes. Yeah. Exactly. So we have a number of organizations here that sort of take care of this for us. Some of it is in the in the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Some of it comes through executive education. Some comes through the university. And then there are other activities, like being involved in Skydeck, which is our incubator and know, etcetera, etcetera.

Me: Wow. Sounds busy just by listing it there, I can I could appreciate it? That's wonderful. I appreciate the time.

Them: It's been and it's been cold here. So I don't you're in the Midwest, so

Me: Alright. Mhmm.

Them: it's been warm. Right?

Me: No. I've been yeah. I'm in the East in our case and New England, and it it's been hot. Nineties, 95, 99, which is

Them: No.

Me: normal for a Boston area. So we've swapped this year for sure. Interesting. Well, I appreciate the time given your busyness.

Them: You're welcome.

Me: I wanted to pick your brain on on two fronts and to thank you, by the way, for connecting with Bill so often as well. I know he really appreciates the the lunches and and the like. I think it sounds like you've you guys have hit it off. So one of them is just any high level, you know, brain picking on program in general. We are planning to apply for a phase two and just sort of gearing up and thinking about that. And then we're thinking more broadly about user ourselves, and I'd love to get some thoughts on, you know, our how we might approach that and be provide get some, some assistance in that

Them: Yeah.

Me: organizationally. So on the on the post side, you know, we are we are working under the assumption that it still exists We've applied to this enough times that we've got the material, so it's, you know, the the the eye is small, and so the ROI is decent anyway. But I guess, a, any thoughts you have on that? And then b, I've got a couple sort of posed geeky that you might have perspectives on or not at all. I know. But

Them: Sure.

Me: I presume I I'm I'm presuming it's still up on the web. Everybody's board is if it's on the web, it's still around. We don't know what that means, but you know, might as well you you miss all the shots you don't take. Right?

Them: Correct. That that is correct. It is up on the web.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Molly, who was the Pose administrator while she was there as a rotator, was quite clear that Pose is going to continue, that the funding is still there.

Me: Okay.

Them: So I feel very confident about that. However, I you know, it's the current administration. I have no idea when, and I think it's

Me: Right. Exactly. It's mhmm. Yes.

Them: pulled. And when it gets pulled, it just happens to get pulled.

Me: Course. Yeah. Yeah. We we all understand that level. Well, it's good good to know that people said,

Them: Yep. Yep.

Me: well, it's still it's still a thing in which in other cases, we're charging at may or may not be as much reassurance. So that that's all all fine.

Them: Correct. And then I don't know what the application process is gonna look like because the sponsors, the the program officers,

Me: Right.

Them: for Pose have all departed.

Me: Of course. Mhmm.

Them: So there's a when you send in an application, who does it go to, and is that relationship there? You know, all of that stuff is kind of up in the air from my standpoint. So what I would suggest is that you attempt to find out who the reviewers are

Me: Mhmm.

Them: which I know is a really hard thing to do, but I think you can just sort probe into the NSF. Ruth is still there. Ruth Schumann is still there.

Me: Right. Yep. Okay. That's good to know. Mhmm.

Them: So you can always ask her and just see what the the relationships might be.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And then just, again, develop the relationship. The application process

Me: Right. Exactly. It's

Them: is the same. And with it for a phase two, I think you're you're in good shape. I mean, you've done phase one. You did a great job with phase one, and

Me: right. Yep.

Them: yeah,

Me: Exactly. Yeah. So the only other questions I had on that, you know, and they are they're worth what they're worth given that there's no institutional memory, so who knows? But have you in any of your intersection with Poe's gathered any inklings on what makes things successful at phase two, either in the actual execution and or the proposing stage of things, you what people are looking for, what kinds of things are meaningful to on, that may be a distinction that's not meaningful to you. But

Them: It is it's it should be meaningful to me, but I can just

Me: Yeah. Sure.

Them: give you the the the takeaway from my standpoint. Looking at the teams that are coming in with phase two grants. Is that there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of segmentation. So there you know, the phase one, phase two definitions of, you know, planning and execution. It seems like that would be clear, right, is that you'd be able

Me: Sure. Her theory, you're a

Them: come in, and you and you would look at all the phase two teams, and you look at all the phase one teams, and you'd say, oh, there's clear definition. In fact, there really isn't.

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: So it's really just coming in with a strong execution oriented application. That doesn't look like you are how do you describe it, That this money is not needed. Right? Is it it should show up as a yeah. This is an important thing for us. You know that already. You've done grants before.

Me: Yep. Exactly. Mhmm. The only finer point question I had on it is the I think if there is a distinction, it's that the phase twos are looking for some type of organization to be managing this open source ecosystem, etcetera. In our thinking about it, we've, you know, connected in with various folks who have

Them: Mhmm.

Me: created separate ones, most of the time because of the need to extricate the tentacles of a university system or what have you more than anything else. And we've talked

Them: Yes.

Me: this already that we probably don't need to do that. So I'm we're sort of working under the presumption that I was saying we're gonna make a little, you know, section of ourselves and call that the organization and bring in lots of people from the

Them: Perfect.

Me: etcetera. And just assuming there's not just double checking that there's not some issue there that they're gonna say, oh, no. You're you know, it was self serving or what have you or

Them: No. Not at all. I mean, I think there are organizations that were in the first post programs that are gonna end up being attached to Linux or attached to Apache or attached somewhere. And I have no idea what that's gonna mean for the applications of phase two. I actually don't think it's gonna matter a whole lot because they're really looking at the community aspects.

Me: Right.

Them: And the organizational aspects of pulling out of the university

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: is a great thing to use the grant for. Right? This is simply creating your own organization or a

Me: Right. Right.

Them: spin down, right, a spin off of of what your that that looks

Me: Mhmm. Sure.

Them: really good. Right? It's it's an independent organization, and you can define it that way.

Me: Yep. Mhmm. Yeah. No. That's great. So wonderful. We'll charge ahead on that, and I think we are well prepared by the work that we did in phase one to understand that and think we're we've been well poised for it in the past, so we'll hope that that plays forward.

Them: So just out of, semantics,

Me: Yeah.

Them: is this gonna be a project of your organization or a new organization with a new name?

Me: So that's a valid question. So, we've been using the word

Them: Yeah.

Me: center often as a noun, without knowing really what it means, but it sounds good. I think so I think it would be a it would not be a separate five zero one c three or LLC or what have you. What

Them: Mhmm.

Me: not technically trying to make us something, but I think we would consider it a low above the organization that, you know, what did its own thing to manage this ecosystem and could take in funds and what have you in a way that the the money was in some way accounted for to help push that ecosystem forward, we probably wouldn't get into the financial

Them: Yeah.

Me: details, but it's it is it's not not separate. But it's but it takes advantage of the the umbrella that we have already existing legally, etcetera. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. And I think that's an important point to make. The grant application is just if you're gonna call it a center within your organization, is there you know? And this is all about the pose

Me: Right.

Them: circumstance. Is there an overhead rate that you're charging that's gonna go to the overall organization? I know I have no idea how they're gonna look at that. Obviously, at phase one, if you're coming into an academic organization, you're going to have an overhead rate

Me: Yep.

Them: I'm sure you had an overhead rate or an indirect rate.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Built in. Yeah. I I don't think that's gonna have an impact, but

Me: Right.

Them: just clearly distinguishing that.

Me: It's a good question. No. No. It's useful. You still think about teasing out any distinctions we can and, you know, making sure we cross over any that are problematic in a way that's not, you know, being dubious or what have you. Good good question.

Them: Yes. Yeah. So one thing I I get to ask you, which is

Me: Good. Please.

Them: in this program, I have become more and more interested in the community aspects. Of all of the programs and then seeing communities more and more and more in a for profit world. Where they're being leveraged in a particular way in this whole idea or concept of community being an important way of viewing a set of customers.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And it gets stretched and pulled and pushed on a whole bunch of different ways. But one of the interesting things about

Me: Right.

Them: open source is that you don't know your community very well. So the question is, can you develop it?

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: And in some respects, it looks a lot like or it sounds a lot like a social network.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Where you have a huge number of people in the social network, a small number of contributors, and then an even smaller number of you know, special people who do most of the work.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's the old you know, it's the old social network model.

Me: Like, Mhmm.

Them: So I'm curious what you think of that analogy.

Me: I mean, so I don't profess to know as much about community as I sometimes talk about regarding it. I think we have you know, we in our organization and within the code app work too haven't done as great a job as we might hope to pull up forward. That being said, I think there is one there within the code

Them: Mhmm.

Me: work, and we probably have one in our organization as well that we don't, you know, avail ourselves of. I think that those layers apply. I mean, I think they're human. You know, they they're reflective of human sort of investment and effort and there's a so there's a reason that they apply as a sort of a model. And I think I can imagine people who sit within each of those ratio buckets, and they're probably the kind of ratios you'd expect, in terms of the specialness and investment of time and what have you. And and I what I don't have as much of a view on is how generalizable that is and where it breaks down in other situations. But you know, with the the n o the random n o one of Kodap fitting that mold, thinking about other situations as well, whether it's Maker or communities or other kinds of things. I mean, I think that that's I think that's a pretty meaningful mold. What I don't know is where the actions that emerge from that paradigm break down and don't you know, so we use social network models for certain artifices and certain, you know, orientations that come around it. That you might you'd find as you poke at it that, you know, they look the same, but they're actually very different animals. And I don't know where

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the model's

Me: can and can't apply the models. Mhmm.

Them: just apply mathematically, but I and, you know, there's a wide variance in the way the community is managed and how much you know about each one of the members of the community and how tightly connected they are. But that's a social science question, and

Me: Right.

Them: not not being a social scientist, I'm not gonna enter into that.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Discussion. It's more of when I think about managing this,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: as a nonprofit that might have something that's gone out into the world through GitHub you know, to to how do you even approach it? Some organizations approach it with a community manager. Some organizations don't approach it that way, and they just have a loose affiliation affiliation on Discord.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Know, whatever it might be.

Me: Mhmm. That's that's a good question. Yeah.

Them: And so I just don't know the management piece. And I think that's the hardest part when we teach this is, like, if I was to we're gonna kick up a program here soon just to give them best practices of how how does this work. And what is the math behind it.

Me: Right. Yeah. No. That's interesting. Are there

Them: Yeah.

Me: is there anything empirical that would put the different in management approaches into buckets or, you know, differentiate them in any way.

Them: I think I

Me: Or or do we even know that there are different approaches really, or are they all the same in the end? I don't know.

Them: they all look the same in the end. There are some more active. Where there's you know, I I would say that there's an approach that has the close in maintainer contributor technical adviser, committee type organizations, and then a set of committers or contributors, however you wanna describe that. And then a networked group of people, and then another network group of people which are not

Me: Right.

Them: part of the network, right, who are out there. So it becomes an unknown

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: about how many community members there are. And what is really challenging for a lot of the

Me: Item.

Them: open source community is just simply who is not a member and who should be a member, who should download but hasn't, and why haven't they? Right? And so

Me: Right.

Them: that's the big issue.

Me: Yeah. That's a good question. Yeah. So what what trellises do we put energy into building versus not is the, you know, question. Yeah. Okay.

Them: Yeah.

Me: That makes a ton of sense.

Them: And so I think that might reflect on your application for Clode app also.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So I you had some more questions for me. I wanna make sure that we get to

Me: Think so. Yeah. That's good. Excellent. Yeah. So the other gears, those are the questions that I have. Is an organizational one. So we're a nonprofit organization funded by federal funding. You know, we we have been.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: We will hopefully continue to be in some fraction or another. We're smaller, you know, next month than we were last month as we're, you know, shifting, you know, to be a more leaner organization, etcetera. And we're thinking more broadly about how we orient to the world in doing that. We're not not applying to NSF, but we're expecting that we need to think about other things as well. All that said, we have traditionally, historically, in our thirty years, you know, been 95% NSF funded, maybe 85% if we're lucky. But, you know, we're really that animal in the in the ecosystem. And as we think about that, and as we think about orienting to other parts of the the funding world or what have you, we have recognized again, helping people internally recognize that our business model has been NSF oriented business model, which is to say, that NSF puts its ideas out, and we respond to those ideas.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Our customers are panel panelists. You know, essentially. And teachers are almost the educators that we're serving are almost exhaust. In the like, they're they're they're looped in as a as a

Them: Yes.

Me: feature we dangle on the tree. But, like, in reality, they don't use our stuff, it doesn't affect our business model much at all. Is the the dirty secret of that. And, you know, is it

Them: Yeah.

Me: nonprofit beneficiaries and funders are are different. You know, maybe even more so in some cases. Long story short, you know, when we talk about users and what have you, you know, I am working to help us, people, internal PIs, whatever, recognize that we don't know the people we think we do or the people we know are the ones that we've been paying and doing for and research projects for a lot. So not very reflective of the world. And also that there are many other people out there who think very carefully about users because their model and their livelihood is depend upon it. So we could tap into this. So long story short, we've got some, you know, philanthropic funding that's willing to help us with coaching as an organization or what have you. And, you know, I'm internally ginning up some, you know, recognition that user discovery is a thing and that we should probably be aware of it

Them: Mhmm.

Me: it could help us even if we're writing grants. It could help us. So I am I'm asking sort of high and low level question on the high level. Okay. And this is a model I think we've seen before or maybe we're smaller, but organization who wakes up to the fact that user discovery might actually matter and has lots of things within it. So we don't have one product if our you know, the problem is we've got 17 things that might or might not be, and it kinda hasn't mattered if they're a product or not. So where to start, you know, finding, places to to think about user discovery around and or, you know, organizationally. And then on the lower level, you know, I know that people do this. Are there good recommendations of somebody or buddies we should call to be a a guide through this wilderness?

Them: Well, the gods through the wilderness at the high level

Me: Yeah. Please.

Them: So just gonna take that up. It's that as the NSF funding drops or, you know, whatever the circumstances might be in the next couple of years,

Me: Yep.

Them: You are correct, and I'm delighted that you said that. It says that the panelists are with the Right? You were writing a grant for them. They wanted to do something, and that might have been a contract or it might have been a grant of some sort. And you were able to fulfill that. And the story that you were telling was the story that the NSF wanted. Right? It was a very compact set of things that you need to do in your application. Once you get out to the other part of the community, the philanthropic community, first of all, just recognize that the competition out there is going to become fierce. Because you're not the only organization that's having this happen.

Me: Yes.

Them: And so there's a a circumstance. I can just put it this way. It's that the Baker Fellows, which is an organization within Berkeley, which was funding kind of PIs, for you know, potential spin outs. That's the only way I can call it. You know, I've got something I discovered in my lab. I wanna take it out. You know? And they used to have a 100 applications. And this last year, you know, last application round, they were trouble those number of applications. And that's just an indication that the PIs are, like, I gotta go somewhere else. Right? I'm diversifying my resources.

Me: Exactly. Yeah.

Them: And and so that was, like, the moment for me is that everybody else is looking at the same

Me: Right. Of course. Mhmm.

Them: funding sources. And, of course, those are finite sources. So, you know, they

Me: Yep. Yep.

Them: have to deal with that on their own. But this it's not the applications that matter anymore when used to do the philanthropic piece. It is the stories. It is the beneficiary story. That you're trying to get out. And so you can look at con, Academy and say, you know, let's look at them and understand how they're telling their stories. Because the philanthropic people want to be able to reflect that story in in what they're doing. They wanna feel good. About their beneficiaries. And, you know, to the extent that you're the vehicle to make that happen, can understand that for you. Very directly. So, that shift from my value proposition to being to the panel the value proposition to the to the beneficiary. And in your situation or CODEB situation, it's both the faculty the teacher,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and the student and those two stories have to come back out.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Now there we use a guy by the name of David Reamer to do all of our storytelling work. Right? So he's written a book called getting your startup story straight. And the last name is r I e m e r. And just I would download it put it on Kindle. I'll just run through it real quick.

Me: Great.

Them: What he's doing is really creating the story that goes into a pitch.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right? So if you go to a philanthropist or if you go to a foundation or you name it, you know, you not only have a application process, but you have a it's now you, Chad, going and telling a story.

Me: Right. Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: And, you know, this is super important. And all I can say that despite our desire to teach that to every sort of student I mean, what David just spent three hours with a group of executive MBAs that I was teaching last week. The just takes months to develop these stories. I hate to say it that way.

Me: Yeah.

Them: The the students respond to it like, oh, this is super important. I love it. You know? It's great. You're telling stories, and you're helping me tell stories. But they don't get it right away. It usually takes a lot of time and iteration to get those stories to come out. For you, it's really reflecting the story from your users and being able to package that in a way that is coherent.

Me: Right? Mhmm.

Them: And then your story on top of that. So your story sits on top or vice versa, and you're trying to fit these two things together. There are lots of storytellers out there. David is one of the best. But you know, he's he's a retired individual from, you know, that you know, he chooses his businesses.

Me: Right.

Them: Along the way.

Me: Exactly.

Them: So I would I would suggest that you try to find your own internal staff who wanna help develop the story or find somebody else's storyteller in your community. If you're in the Boston area, there are tons of them. And

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: they can sometimes come from the entertainment industry. They can come from the business side. Know, and they have different skills and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and whatnot so they can tell.

Me: How and where would you differentiate slash pair that with, the sort of user discovery user development side of things, which I think is, you know, a big blind spot for us in general and feels like we need to don't know where the cart and the horse is, but we need to understand that. And I feel as if it as if understanding that maybe I'm just telling myself this. But is is not at at least not counterposed to the NSF model too. Like, if we are proposing things that we know people want, then all the better. We're very good at writing these NSF proposals. We can continue to do that on the side. If we're

Them: Yeah.

Me: doing them from that we have that have value propositions, then maybe they come out with money on the end too or something. Mhmm.

Them: Correct. Correct. They it is the cart and the horse at the same time.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So the the customer discovery piece lends itself to the storytelling because then you can put the concreteness in.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And the way I would describe this is that you can tell a story about the generic user, or the generic teacher, but that doesn't connect. It lands, but it doesn't land in a way. I hate that I hate that terminology land. It just

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: like, it's not my not my language. It doesn't have the impact. But when you can tell the the story of a teacher who's in a particular school teaching a particular thing, and you can get that into a thirty second compact. Here's why they're using this. Then that name brand of that individual, somebody that can call they can call really makes it happen.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And so the customer discovery piece is you know and and I know this is from the last post session. You have lots of different users doing lots of different work, teaching a lot of different people both at the, you know, lower levels, like in the fifth grades grade, eighth grade, and at the upper levels at the, you know, high school level. And probably some outside of that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Using Codeb. So it's a matter of choosing which one of those stories resonates

Me: Mhmm.

Them: the best. So the customer discovery piece is really getting those stories. The beginning, you know, and the the quick sort of lesson is from that customer discovery, you want to pull out the problem statement that they had

Me: Yes. Yes.

Them: why they chose Kodap,

Me: Yep.

Them: Right? That's the beginning of your story. The end of the story, I would leave in mode, which is they want more Right? So they did this. They have an impact of x number of students per year or whatever the case might be, but they really want more. And therefore, we need funding to continue this program. Right?

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm. Yep.

Them: And so that's that's the connection.

Me: Yeah. So that's great. Organizationally, the interesting question is so we have code app, which is, you know, Bill and folks you know, and then we have, you know, 20 different other things. You know, we have seven other PIs and 12 programs and, you know, dozen, literally dozens of NSF grants historically for different projects and things. So we have lots

Them: Mhmm.

Me: of toys in the toy chest. So one of the interesting questions is how we determine sort of where to start with product development or munging together or what have you when you got that large you know, you you have any advice or sense of, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: who come in? And I think big organizations do this too. They say, oh, we're gonna make an r and b, you know, skunk works over there. What do we choose, you know, from all of, you know, fill in the blank. Right? Mhmm.

Them: Right. I mean, this is the challenge. And so when I put a

Me: Right.

Them: there was an Apache slide that I used, and I think you can still find this where they have projects that come into the Apache system and then projects that depart the

Me: Alright.

Them: Apache system.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And that's a life cycle circumstance. Right? Some come in, they last ten years, and then they run out of users because they've been leapfrogged by somebody else.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That happens

Me: Mhmm.

Them: all the time. If I look at a portfolio of 12, 15, activities, I have to look at them and say, one is really surviving? Which one can grow? Which one's kinda dying off. And really be pretty direct about the ones that are dying off.

Me: Right.

Them: Because it's not like you have to kill them, but you have to sunset them at some point.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And sunsetting is the hardest thing. I was surprised. One of the programs here at Berkeley they described a sunsetting process that they had where they did sunsetting every ten years.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And it was just simply a recognition that life changes. Right? We can do this stuff forever because funders will fund you. NSF or NIH or whatever will fund you forever. But it's not good to the business. It's not good to the faculty. It's not good to the PhD students to keep that going because it just ends up being a dead end project. So there's the strategic level which is where you're at, Chad, which is which one of these projects do you wanna continue with and which ones do you wanna bring in. And I think you can have a good sense of that. There's the level below, which is okay. You've done code apps. Through this program. And you've done the customer discovery. How would you do customer discovery across all the other ones?

Me: Right.

Them: And really start to understand, okay. Where's

Me: Yep. Exactly. Yes.

Them: where's the market that we're not addressing? Right? And how good is the market that we are addressing? How how tight are the switching costs?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: In that activity.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And so I do a bunch of that work you know, but I I charge money for it. So

Me: Sure. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's fine. And we're and we're expecting and and so be clear. I'm asking you for advice, not necessarily asking you for the consulting, although that would be fine. Part of the reason I'm asking this question is because I think we're at an juncture, and I do have some resources, you know, pledged to do some organizational coaching and realizing that there might be an opportunity. I think the opportunity is in that level, but the biggest one is in that level below. I think would get lots of exercise for PIs around user discovery trying to do that exercise. And out of it, we would also find some value propositions that we had been ignoring or understand where to tighten our user base.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Agreed. Agreed. You know, but I think that's a year long process with

Me: Mhmm. Yep. I can try.

Them: projects. I mean, that's a that's a huge undertaking at some level.

Me: Mhmm. Yep. Mhmm.

Them: They're for profit companies that, you know, do this on a continuous basis.

Me: Yep.

Them: But they have somebody who's either dedicated to it or as a startup was dedicated to it, and they're constantly doing customer feedback.

Me: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: But there's a challenge with software. It's not a challenge. It's an opportunity more than anything. It's a sometimes the usage patterns this is the hard part to figure out with respect to a lot of the software patterns. You're a for profit company and you have access to the customer, you're watching how they use the product.

Me: Right. Exactly.

Them: Right? You're fully instrumented in terms of what's going on with a

Me: Mhmm.

Them: with this particular product, you may not have any instrumentation out in the field to tell you, oh, they don't use that version. They're using this version. Or they don't use that feature. They're using this feature. And you get that data exhaust

Me: Mhmm. Right.

Them: Right? And there can be a difference between the customer discovering the data exhaust

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's the tough thing when you have this type of project is I would suggest you get number of your customers to agree to direct usage

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: monitoring so that you can see them using the product, and they become a special group for you. And, you know, it it breaks some of the free software norms.

Me: No. It's fine. We we've got some that are already because we're doing research anyway. So that

Them: Good. Yeah.

Me: then some of that would not be an issue at all. So yeah. And I think the the question more

Them: Yep.

Me: know we're running out of time here, but the question more is, to some degree, what's the what's the position name I should be googling and or are there

Them: Yeah.

Me: people who are at this middle level who would be interested in I mean, I see this as a six to nine month getting our feet wet kind of process for us where we're not gonna come out the end with a couple. We know we're gonna leave a lot on on the table and you know, but we will have learned something and know

Them: Yeah.

Me: how to start to replicate that better for ourselves. And,

Them: Where where are you physically in in Massachusetts? Are you in Boston or

Me: we are in in the con in Concord, 40 miles

Them: in Concord? Yeah. So yeah. So what I would do is I would

Me: Boston. Yeah. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Them: contact some of the MIT people and you know, try to get a student and hook them up through one of the they have a or something like that at MIT, and have them take one of the projects

Me: Mhmm.

Them: take it in, have them do the customer discovery with the respect of that project.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And so the person that I can think of right offhand, because she's teaching with me now, is Betsy. And what's Betsy's last name? I can't even remember Betsy's. It's just that's what it's like I just deal with everybody on

Me: Course. Yeah.

Them: on a first name basis. It's a horrible thing.

Me: Yeah. I know. It's understandable.

Them: Betsy. Betsy. Betsy. What's Betsy's name? It is here. Betsy Peters. And her email is Betsy@BetsyPeters.com.

Me: Okay. Okay. Excellent. And the term that you would use for what we're looking for if you were it to somebody, I mean, this simply product discovery or customer discovery, or is there

Them: We can keep it in the customer discovery sense. There's community manager, which

Me: Mhmm.

Them: is more of a

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, it's a position. Right? A customer discovery intern would be one way to think about it or somebody who might do consulting, you know, if you had

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: to pay them or whatever the case might be.

Me: Yep. Exactly. Well, that's great. That's very helpful. I'll start a little bit more what have you. I may send you a question to you via email. But this is really a great start already and helps reconfirm and and reset some of my expectations.

Them: Sounds good.

Me: Appreciate it.

Them: Chad, great to see you.

Me: Thanks a lot. A good afternoon.

Them: Cheers. Bye.

Me: Bye.
