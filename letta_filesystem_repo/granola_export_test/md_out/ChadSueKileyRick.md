Transcript:

Me: Hello. Welcome back.

Them: Hello?

Me: I am

Them: I'm just gonna hit

Me: How how was it? I'm gonna say

Them: oh, it's nice. That's nice. Yeah.

Me: you

Them: I'm gonna hit select all and delete to all my emails if that's okay.

Me: I'm sure that sounds exactly, like, exactly the right plan.

Them: Reading. I'm like, I think I read this before. Did I read this? No response.

Me: I'm sure. Yes. And

Them: How was your vacation?

Me: it was good. When was it? A while back. And we just went to DC. So

Them: Good.

Me: it was nothing huge. But we had a good time. We went to a couple of new museums that were fun. One that our architect friend relatives recommended, so he'd like some of them. There's one that if you're down to DCL, send you info about. It was very cool hedge fund couple that has this free or, you know, in the middle of nowhere museum in Potomac, Maryland that's absolutely gorgeous. And just amazing grounds and the buildings are perfect. Just everything about the whole thing is by edict is perfect essentially. And

Them: Oh, wow. I'm, yeah, I'm curious. Send it to me.

Me: so it was yeah, it was very cool.

Them: Yeah. Alright.

Me: Alright. Here is Rick.

Them: So there's no strategy meeting tomorrow. Right? Looks like

Me: There is not one on the schedule. Well, I've got a couple other like, random things that delay me until later. So I didn't end up scheduling one. Probably, I should have. But, hey, Rick.

Them: Rick. Hey, Sue. Hey, Chad.

Me: I'm I'm regrouping this morning too even though I was back last week. So

Them: I know. One week vacation, the rest of the summer, we're regrouping from vacation.

Me: it pretty much

Them: Vacation.

Me: feels like a and

Them: How are you, Rick? I'm doing well. Thank you. Doing well. Back in DC.

Me: Alright. Good.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good and bad.

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. We

Them: Yes.

Me: we all know that painful reentry from

Them: Yeah.

Me: other worlds

Them: Yes.

Me: Hi,

Them: Hey, Kiley. Hey, Kiley. The kids get ready to go back school next week, so that's always a

Me: I'm here.

Them: makes for a lot of running around.

Me: Yeah. I like him.

Them: Oh, that seems so soon. Wow.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Yeah.

Me: We've got a

Them: Yeah.

Me: couple of no. Well, no. Actually, not that much longer. It's about the same for us. So

Them: Gotcha.

Me: so yeah. So this is on Ron's radar, but I don't know how much don't know that we necessarily need to, you know, wait for him to to dig in. I'll check my email again and see if he responded. Yeah. He said he'd join at the beginning. We can give him a minute at least. But I don't think we need to wait if he's delayed.

Them: You want me just to jump in?

Me: Yeah. Let's do that.

Them: Okay. And just a little while ago, I sent you guys over an agenda, so that should be in your

Me: I see.

Them: inbox.

Me: Yep.

Them: Did did you get it? Did you say don't see? Oh, okay. Great. Okay. So first thing I had was just an update sort of well, I guess, not closing out, but but the an updated report on where we stand with development director the process that we put into it. Chad, I don't know if you all need something. And so to align with the you know, the project, in terms of, you know, some sort of closeout report for the you know, for for the project that we just did on the development director.

Me: Don't I don't think so. No. I think we've got I think we have what we need

Them: Okay. But if that's sort of attached, Yeah. I mean, if if you want something more different, I'm happy

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, do whatever it is that you all need. But it gives you a summary of of what we did, the numbers we had apply, and that sort of thing, and sort of the process. In case the board wants to, you know, ask questions or anything like that.

Me: Okay. Yeah. That's great.

Them: Everything generally should be answered in it. But, also, I'm happy to to dig in further if you need that. So that's attached. There's a initial calendar for Danielle when she comes on board on the second.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's attached. I'd I'd I'd I'd encourage you all to look at it and sort of let me know what you think and how it's set up. What might be missing, if you want something different. But in in in my mind, think it's good for her to see what I think she should be doing next and for you all to see that she's probably gonna, you know, really dramatically change this. Based on however, you know, she likes to work. But this would will at least get you started. And and if this is sort of along the lines of what you guys think, I'll build it out more through the end of the year. Happy to carry it into the into next year too. September, on that on that document is built out pretty well. And I'll follow that format if that works for you.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So maybe you don't have to look at it now, obviously, but click you know? Give me feedback on how to let me know what you think. I think the last the last thing, specific to that project is that all of the I believe all of the nos and these sort of no thank yous have been sent out to the candidates. So we're sort of we're sort of done there.

Me: Awesome.

Them: I think. Oh, great. Okay. Yeah. In terms of, communications and you know, the work with Cynthia and and with that also is from a from the initial contract is sort of getting to the point where it's closer to being done in terms of the deliverables. With two two outstanding items. One is we've talked about building a support us page that will fit within structure of your website. And I don't think that's going to be done probably until Danielle gets here.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Which gives her an opportunity to to weigh in on it. That will be a page that lists all of the different ways, at least in my mind, that folks can support the organization. And I think it's particularly important for organizational funders to be able to go there and sort of see the different types of ways, you know, a company might might support you, a foundation might support you. Etcetera. It also builds that constant drumbeat of, hey. We're we're out here. Looking for financial support or nonprofit, etcetera, etcetera. Most nonprofits have a page like that. And, actually, I sent over to Cynthia at some point a list of six or eight sample pages from websites that I like and if you guys are interested in That is being built. That takes a little bit of time. Kiley's in on that on that project too. And I think will be something that just gets handed off to Cynthia to finalize. Or not to Cynthia. I'm sorry. To Danielle to final. The other item that's not finished yet, but we're we're closing up on is a sole source for Danielle to look for language of the common language of Concord that's been approved by everyone. It's got numbers and metrics that everyone agrees to. And and it's sort of a a place that she'll pick and choose language that she wants to go in a deck or to go in a proposal. And we're we're moving along on that. I think there's some questions about some numbers that Cynthia was digging into. In Navy. Maybe getting this in front of you, Chad, to see you know, what you

Me: She and I briefly touched base on that. I'd I'm aware of the the constant new sort of ambiguities that are involved in that piece, but, you know, we haven't dug the next layer down. I'm happy to help as I can. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. Yeah. Just That's right. Can I I'm sorry, Rick? Can I is there a place where that lives, the draft of it? I mean, for me, it lives Google's and on my system. But I think Cynthia said you all have a an area that she's got for that type of language. And that's the goal is to have one place one source Then really, think we can go to, but certainly Danielle will need to go to it.

Me: Yeah. And there's there's not a single place where it lives

Them: So maybe that's a question for for Cynthia or I don't know if you know

Me: right now, at least as of my last check\-in with her on the

Them: Okay.

Me: eleventh, less than a week ago or a week ago, the open question was, like, there are three places where we have this info. You know, maybe something's progressed since then, but

Them: It needs to the the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: language itself needs to live on the Internet. So that it is centrally accessed by everybody. The draft right now, I don't know where that lives. Sue, that's a good question. I just looked in like our strategic development drive, and it's not in, like, website and communication. So maybe she has it somewhere else. And then the thing that she was hoping she could get some answers on from you, Chad, was

Me: The numbers.

Them: you know, numbers. Right?

Me: Yeah. Yeah. That's least that's ambiguous right now.

Them: We're they're very, very they're

Me: Mhmm.

Them: quite variable. They very different from one another, not by a small percent. So we need a single source of truth, and we need to be able to up

Me: Yep.

Them: access that single source of truth every year and update the numbers annually. So that the language that Rick is talking about is always most up to date.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Version. Yeah. That would be great. And I can use it. There the auditors are it or not, the auditors are starting to put together the nine ninety. So if I could get that language and include it in our nine ninety, that would be great. Yeah. Because Cynthia's, you know, she's doing it it all ties into everything. Right? She's doing annual she's assembling the annual report as well, which, you know, she knows she's, like, she's got the draft of the twenty twenty four one and we're already ready to start drafting the twenty twenty five one. But we need numbers, and we need them to be whether they're true or not, we just need one source of

Me: Right. Yeah.

Them: It it it show up everywhere. Right?

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: But but airing on the side of truth. Yeah. Okay. It would be lovely if they were

Me: Yes. And

Them: true, but it would be, you know,

Me: Yeah. They're all they're all throwing their own way. Let's just figure out which

Them: we just Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And this is a really con this is a really

Me: we want, totally. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: really common issue. I I think I've seen it in every organization I've worked at. But I think

Me: Yeah.

Them: that's something that and you'll see it below. That Danielle and Cynthia, I think, would be working on annually and sort of figuring out

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, when do we adjust these numbers and and and where are they on the website?

Me: Right.

Them: Because they're gonna be in a lot of different spots you may forget. Etcetera. And it you know? So I think it's just important that particularly those two roles and those two people kinda have a sense in their heads

Me: Mhmm.

Them: of of how they deal with it.

Me: Right.

Them: And and I know just from, you know, past practice, Danielle will need to be just be able pull that language. And and pop it in where she needs it. There's also a PowerPoint deck, which has been I'm not sure if Cynthia created it or she just surfaced it, but there's a good PowerPoint deck of a blank template that that Daniel will be able to to use as well. And all of that will live in a spot like you guys were just talking about that's accessible to every seat. Donate button went live last week. Very it's always a very exciting day for me when it happens. What's that? I just did it.

Me: Awesome.

Them: Alright.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Was really work, Ron? Was very easy.

Me: Good.

Them: Yeah. One of the easiest I've

Me: That's great.

Them: I've used, and that includes art. Oh, that's good news. K. Yeah. Yeah. And I went through the process and and you know, everything seemed to work for me. The number one, your number one appeal, which means your first time appeal, going out to your large email list I think it's your e news subscribers. Is ready, I think, for final review.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Chad. And, Sue, I don't know if you have a hand in that too. In terms of language And then the timing, you know my thoughts I'm aggressive. Let's get this thing out the door. Danielle can can see the initial reporting and be involved in that. We can wait. You know? I mean, now she's gonna be here in two weeks. We can wait and and have her do it. But we just wanna sort of understand where we're at on that. I know I was holding up part of it because we wanted to get PayPal as one of the options on there, and, I finally have PayPal and our bank account hooked up, but I need to contact Qgive and get the on that end. So Gotcha. Okay. So I had I hadn't heard that. So okay. Good to know. Good to know. So that's ready to go when

Me: Yeah.

Them: and in chat, I think you need a maybe you've already done a, like, a final review of that language because it

Me: No. I haven't I haven't looked at that yet, so I need to look at that too.

Them: yeah. That's under I think that's under your signature. So

Me: Mhmm. Yep.

Them: Yep. Everything on the web and and the new materials looks complete to me in terms of, you know, what was in my what was in my proposal, my project, and and what we've picked up since. And I think your I think website looks looks good and strong for a fundraising point of view. The staff board email oh, okay. So you did the internal email. It went out to your staff and went out to your board. You know, just it was mainly to test things, and I think that went pretty well. Kiley, maybe since you said there was one issue that popped up with a board member, but it was resolved pretty quick. I don't remember what that was. One failed payment. That's all. Okay. But I've I've now gone through it twice. It seems to work pretty well for me. Glad to hear that we're for you, Ron. Now I will say, as we move into the board part, the last I heard, I think there was three or four donations from your board.

Me: Right.

Them: And, obviously, you're targeting a 100%.

Me: Yep. We have a

Them: So

Me: a meeting on Friday, so and I put that on the on the agenda and the

Them: gotcha. Okay.

Me: I mentioned it in the pack that I sent out. So I'll

Them: Okay.

Me: I'll hit that on Friday for sure.

Them: And and, Chad, I you know, there are some folks that kinda well, I make my donations on December 30\. And and I just don't wanna veer from that. So you may hear that. I I I don't know.

Me: Yeah. I've I I don't I think we'll we'll just

Them: You definitely wanna try and get that 100%. Okay.

Me: get people to to make it happen. It's more of a reminder and to let them know why it's important.

Them: Okay. And and in the calls that I've had with board members and and talking with you, Chad, with you, Sue, there's a couple things that have surfaced. About the board itself. There seems to be consensus that there should be a development committee don't know if that's something you wanna put in place. Right now or what the timing of that is. If you want anything from me, would be helpful, language, roles, and responsibilities of that of that development committee, let me know. I'm happy to, you know, port forward language that I have and and whatnot. If you want language about the 100% giving, to go into your bylaws, I can also help with that. I'd probably need to see your bylaws just to see what the format is. But I can I can help with that? So just let me know. It's it's pretty simple, and I've got some templates somewhere of that stuff. And then so those two items, yeah, those two items are specifically about the board and fundraising. And then the next question is it was raised again on board calls. Is how can we see the board see who Concord is targeting for funding.

Me: Right.

Them: On a regular basis. And I don't know Chad, Ron, Sue, whomever, if you have thoughts on what that would look like. Or if you want me to just suggest a way to do it in a frequency and that sort of thing or wait for Danielle or or how you wanna attack that issue. But it's a good issue to have It's great that the the, you know, folks I've talked to seem to wanna at least get involved that far

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, to be able to vet list and and sort of see that So I'm happy to help. In a way that you want me to. I don't wanna take the lead on it. Without, you know,

Me: Right. Yeah. I feel like it's, you know,

Them: some guys.

Me: I feel like there's definitely an opportunity for Danielle to make connections with board members and to to sort of put a a you know, imprint on what she thinks the, you know, the sort of communication is from from there. And I don't know that the you know, that there's an immediacy that requires us to have a template ready to go on day two for her necessarily. She'll be at the board meeting for a brief you know, hello. I didn't I told her I wasn't gonna, you know, have her force her to report anything, but but the fact that she's around, she might as well come say say hi and and wave and let people know who she is. So she'll have seen the board members at least this coming Friday. But it feels like that's you know, there's an opportunity to discuss what the what the right kind of reporting is from her standpoint and where to get board feedback, you know, across that September timeline.

Them: Sounds good. Okay. And then for the general fundraising, so the way I see it, and, again, Daniel may may wanna flex this or change it. Is you have three direct you have enough time to do three direct email efforts this year. Assuming one goes out in the next handful of weeks. The first one would be your first appeal. Second one would be there's a there's a there's a day called giving Tuesday, which is sort of a it's a made up day, obviously, but it started maybe about ten years ago with online December, though. Right? It's, like, December 3, Ron, which is a terrible know what the heck they're doing, you know, with that because it's it's usually earlier in

Me: Right.

Them: November, and pre thanksgiving. There's there's real solid reasoning as to why it should be that timing. This year is strange, and it is December 3, which could be your second email. Effort. Mhmm. And then end of the year giving, which you'll wanna I think, from Concord's point of view, you'll wanna sort of be not super aggressive which to me means you start emailing know, maybe around the twenty seventh. Of December, you know, and do maybe a series of three or four emails through the through the thirty first. Through the morning of the thirty first. So you've got those three things coming up. Obviously, Danielle's gonna, you know, put her imprint on on certainly the last two and whether you do whether you do the giving to or not. We'll have to see. But that those are coming up. We talked about forgiving. Expectations on targets and numbers for the remainder of 2025\. I've heard this question from the folks on this call. Hold on a second. The question from the board members.

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: And I've heard the question from Danielle.

Me: I know.

Them: They're all the same questions, sort of.

Me: Yeah. And Brau,

Them: What what's our expectation?

Me: Ron, you're jumping in to bring us back to something

Them: Yeah. After a cutoff date, I I

Me: Mhmm.

Them: do individual emails to board members who haven't given. So pick a date, And if you haven't heard,

Me: That's a good point. I I like that.

Them: well, haven't heard by now, but maybe after Labor Day.

Me: Yeah. Right. Well, we got a meeting on Friday, so I can I can reinforce things that

Them: Oh, yeah. You can say it. I would just say I've we

Me: meeting on Friday and then tell them what we're aiming? By by the time Danielle comes in, the second, you know, would be my goal to say, you know, I'd love to tell her we got a 100% you know, participation.

Them: Yeah.

Me: If we don't, then I'll mail people that week too. You know, remind them.

Them: Okay. Got it. What I'm talking about, though, with c is is, for c is everyone I've talked to, at the at the organization, you know, has asked some version of the question of how many foundations and corporations and whatnot do we wanna target, will we target, will we reach. You know, with funding gas by the 2025\. And I guess what I wanna get from you guys is do you want me to set what I think that number could be In other words, do want me to create sort of a goal for Danielle to target or do you wanna wait till she's on board? How do you wanna approach that?

Me: I mean, that was my biggest question for this call is is how to ride the line between the sort of setup and pre you know, and sort of getting the ball rolling work that we're doing and the handover to Danielle and, you know, the the piece that I'm not that is sort of open question to me is how, you know, where that line lies between, you know, setting somebody up really nicely and, you know, over managing in a way gonna make her feel imposed upon. I mean, I think I wanna air on the side of of progress more than than not.

Them: Right.

Me: But, obviously, you wanna give her the space to, you know, carve her carve her niche as well. I mean, I think we can plead ignorance and and, you know, describe what we've done in lots of different ways. So it's certainly we're certainly well within our, you know, well within our scope to say. We've been thinking lot about targets and some things in with Rick, and we weren't sure it was starting and here's, you know, here's the plan that we've had so far. And you know, as opposed to saying, like, what's your plan on September 3? You know, I think it's better better to have more and get pushed back than than not. I don't know. The other open question we can talk about later on or not is how much, you know, overlap connection hand holding, you know, you wanna have with Danielle and and what that relationship is, and that's a a slightly different, you know, kind of light touch or hard touch conversation. In terms of having something to lay on the desk and say, this is what we're thinking so far, it feels like you know, it'd be good to have something, you know, and media is not bad if she wants to sort of have rationale and push back, that that's great.

Them: But I think you just as a baseline, I

Me: Right.

Them: I wanna know. Even if we don't share with Danielle, I wanna know what a reasonable amount is.

Me: Yeah. Exactly. Also.

Them: For us to I think so. And if we look at foundations, which I've been looking at a little bit the last couple days, so I've the numbers at the top of my head. I think you're I think there's probably realistically, 15 to 20 sort of private foundations, maybe mostly family foundations, Some are well known families. That have deadlines and seem to me to be a fit by the end of the year. Okay? So it's not like we have a hundred. That we could apply to. Right? So I think that target is sort of reasonable. And and maybe we exhaust that 15 to 20\. Certainly. And and I think from a from a fundraiser's point of view, if I'm coming onto your staff, I certainly think that's doable in the months of it it really would be work done most likely

Me: Mhmm.

Them: September and October. Right? Because the the the the application dates are gonna be later in October and some will be in November prior to Thanksgiving. There won't be many foundations

Me: Right.

Them: that will accept anything after Thanksgiving until, you know, the January season starts back up. Okay? When we think about corporations and corporate foundations, it's a little bit looser. Just because many don't list dates and many don't have, like, an actual cycle. It's sort of when you knock on the door, you you you get considered. So that is a little bit more to me wanna say guesswork because that doesn't sound right, but that's a little more

Me: Right.

Them: an open ended question about how aggressive we think Danielle can be And and, frankly,

Me: Yep.

Them: Chad and and what Ron and Sue think, but think it's maybe a a conversation to be had with her If we can define what the foundations look like, right, and and sort of give her that number,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: The corporations to me is a little bit more, what do you think we're gonna be prepared for? You know? And and maybe it's not a conversation you have on the third or the second. Maybe it's a conversation you have on the tenth or the twelfth. Once she's had sort of a sense to say, okay. We've got you know, these things in place, but we're missing all this. I've gotta prioritize these things. I I think that's the approach I would take.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Chad, in terms of of with corporations. High net worth individuals, I'm gonna say, unless a high net worth individual somehow presents themselves,

Me: Yeah.

Them: I would hold off on setting targets goals around that.

Me: Yeah.

Them: You know, revenue stream

Me: Mhmm.

Them: until 2026\. And government funding I think, she's probably just gonna slot into whatever role you all have. I don't think she's gonna be driving.

Me: No.

Them: Don't think this position is gonna be driving government funding from what I understand about how y'all work now.

Me: Yep.

Them: Rather, she's gonna be helpful where she can be helpful. You know? And then if we look at, like, the smaller community foundations, I understand you all do some stuff maybe within the state. And you're looking at, you know, community foundations that might provide smaller for maybe lower level 5 figure grants that can kind of be ongoing. Right?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: That's my, at least, initial take on across the board. Fundraising. And the emails will be the emails, and you guys aren't gonna be sending out any direct mail

Me: Mhmm.

Them: at least that I understand. I am right up.

Me: No.

Them: That. Right? You don't do a direct mailing at the end of the year. Right? No. That's not. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. That that all seems alright.

Them: So do we have a

Me: Sorry, Gustaf.

Them: do we have a list of, top found you know, the first the first grouping that you started with, Rick, do we have those 10 or 15 or 20 private foundations and their dates which something is due. Yeah. And this is what I wanna talk about. I I think we're set up Wednesday, and that Wednesday too. Okay. I've got I'm I'm looking right now at at 64\. Foundations. Although, I think there's some there may be still be some duplicates in here. That are generally I think, targets for 100\. Maybe maybe if you add in the smaller community foundations, maybe 120, 130\. That are annual targets for you guys. Okay? Okay. So if if we wanna we can go over this and on Wednesday, I've probably got dates for about half of them right now. Okay. Fine. Yeah. And I and that's where I get the number. I think there's probably about 15 or 20, Sue. That you could realistically apply for this year. And you'll fit within their guidelines. Don't think there's many more than that. Yeah. I was just I was thinking in my head where we start gathering all of this stuff for Danielle so we can package it up and hand it off. Yeah. She'll she'll get from me a sort of master Excel spreadsheet of everything I've seen of stat your staff, you know, I've I've seen spreadsheets from your staff. That they've given me that they've you know, that they that they see as potential funders. Yep. Obviously, your existing funders. And then and then stem foundations that I know of. Build it out to the point where I feel like it's a pretty good single source of information for Daniel. But also fairly comprehensive. She'll be adding names to it, but she won't be adding a ton of names to it.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Oh. Great. And then that information can get fed into your database and into, you know, sort of a

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Tixler system and all of that. I didn't realize it was gonna be that big. Great. That's great. Yeah. And then corporations number is gonna be higher. Corporate foundations. But it's also like that number I know that there is an end to that now.

Me: Right.

Them: You know, because there's constantly companies coming on board that are interested in STEM or companies that exist that change their interest to STEM, etcetera. That's it's gonna be a less defined universe. If that makes sense. Mhmm. I have to go in a few minutes. Could we jump, if you all don't mind, to

Me: Yeah.

Them: extending Rick? And the opt in I didn't know if you guys wanted to have this conversation on phone, but I I we we had when we last talked,

Me: Yeah.

Them: we had said, or I I think you had said sent sent me,

Me: Yeah.

Them: send me ideas. Send us ideas. I mean, I would opt for you know, the 1,000 discount and I mean, you've been so reasonable already, Rick, and you've done more than your contract.

Me: Yeah.

Them: So I mean, from a board perspective. I think you

Me: Mean, so I I definitely think that that the continuity and your expertise is

Them: deserve

Me: is worthwhile entirely. And I think like I said, the only the only question is making sure that we're you know, setting up Danielle for the sort of right hand off and not

Them: Yeah.

Me: sort of it would setting up odd

Them: Yeah.

Me: You know? But I I think you and Danielle can work that out.

Them: Rick is really good at

Me: In in a way that, you know, sets the right ground rules between the the two of you. And if that's all in place then and she sees you as a resource, as well as we do in continuity, think it's all great.

Them: So does to Susan's point, one thing I think Rick can continue to do once Danielle's on board, it is is identify prospects because Cam told me recently for us you know, you you you go through those that first list of six whatever, and then you need the next list. And the next list is tougher. And I think in some ways, Rick could play a really helpful role there as well as being a a sounding board.

Me: And and and it could be in the the I mean, she she can don't

Them: Anyway,

Me: places where the augmenting is useful. Mean, the corporate sponsorship might

Them: Yeah.

Me: something she's less familiar with that, you know, Rick has gone all on and

Them: Plus, it was helpful for me

Me: that might be a case where you could really help, you know,

Them: Yeah.

Me: launch.

Them: It also was helpful for me as we were ramping up to have Rick's independent you know, observation of how things were going and

Me: I

Them: Rick was very you know, in his own

Me: Mhmm.

Them: in his pleasant way, but firm. He would say, well, this is going well, and this isn't, you know. That's good to have a third party So whatever decision you make, Chad, I'm sure it will be great, but I would opt for the

Me: Yeah.

Them: book. It's only four months.

Me: Yeah. No. I think I think that's perfectly good perfectly appropriate and exactly what I would say as well. And like I said, it's really

Them: Yeah.

Me: really just a question of how would played out in such a way that that the dynamics work well. That's all.

Them: We got it. Yeah.

Me: That's okay, Ron. Thanks so much.

Them: Okay. Sorry. I have to I appreciate that. Alright. Thanks, Ron. Very much. I appreciate it, Ron. I appreciate that, guys. I and I I also

Me: Yeah.

Them: of course, wanna caveat. My my number one goal right now is making sure Danielle were works. For you all. And if for some reason and I don't sense but if for some reason, Danielle and I don't match or she feels like she needs to take it over,

Me: Yeah.

Them: she needs to take it over.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right? And and you need to run with that. I'm always around if something, you know, doesn't work out. But if if if you wanna start with that, that's fine. We go month to month.

Me: Yep.

Them: What yeah. I'm I'm real loose on that stuff. Know? I appreciate it and, you know, you know, if you guys wanna shoot me an email what you wanna do or whatever,

Me: Yeah. That that's

Them: I'll respond with a with a document.

Me: And I think we're we're I we're all in the same place.

Them: Yeah. You wanna wait till she's on board,

Me: I mean, I think I think it's so

Them: whatever you wanna do.

Me: think the way I would frame it, you know, with her is the same way of framing with you is that, you know, that, you know, you've been an incredible resource for us in getting this ramped up and bringing the perspective that we didn't have. We know that there's whole lot we don't know in this, and we don't know what that is most of the time. And, and, you know, we know that you've worked with other people who've come into as a resource for that kind of transition continuity. And so, you know, we've agreed with you that you know, we think keeping you as a resource for her and us would be, you know, great. And that we all know, including you, that she's, you know, here to drive the train and figure out her her niche and that you should be a resource for her as much as anything. And I think we can take that month by month, you know, as we go if we need to. Happy to tell her we're not expecting that be, you know, hanging out for the next eighteen months or anything, but that we're

Them: You see that? Right. Sorry.

Me: expecting that there's some, you know, that that

Them: Right.

Me: wanna set this up as well as we can, and there are

Them: Right.

Me: names, people, ideas that you have that, you know, who should be helpful.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. That that sounds great. So let's I'll I'll shoot you over then month by month and we'll go from there. And, and see how it works. I I think you're gonna be in great shape. Danielle and I have communicated

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: a little bit offline.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Not much. But I think know, I think she's very pleasant to work with. And

Me: Yeah.

Them: think she's I mean, she brings that energy even in offline communication. So I think she's very excited about this role. So good. Okay. K. Great. And and, yeah, we'll we'll I I do feel like the once we get past the foundations, the family foundations, there's more unknowns. Right? And and I you know, in terms of volume for one person, what is realistic?

Me: Yeah.

Them: We're gonna have to see, you know, we're gonna have to see that. Right? Because she still got some lifting to do as as this, you know, development effort begins to shove along the river. She's still got some lifting to do to get it. Going. To to where it's just proposals being cranked out. But I I I think she'll get to a good number I think the foundation number will sort of guide itself over the course of the year. We'll know when the application processes are. You know, there's there's usually a pretty heavy January, mid January to you know, maybe mid March application timing. And and one maybe before the summer, and then you're back in the fall season. There's usually typically two or three sort of times when most foundations accept applications. We're also gonna wanna talk

Me: Mhmm.

Them: you know, building relationships because many of these foundations, if you just send them a LOI or a letter,

Me: Sure.

Them: they're gonna read it.

Me: But

Them: And you're gonna get a nice letter back, but it's gonna be, sorry, but no thanks. Building that really you know. You guys know. It's building that relationship, and and how do we do that? And how can a board help us do that? You know, that's gonna be the process that

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: is gonna take some time.

Me: So it feels like to me, you know, percent of the questions we were talking about earlier on, that sort of a maybe a kind of what you were laying out in in this, but having a working three, six, twelve month, you know, calendar sketch would be really useful, I think, if only as a grounding point, you know, and if she's pushing back or suggesting, that's that's fine. But I think, you know, it's perfectly appropriate for us to go in with her saying, here's what we're thinking so far. You know, we wanna get you launched on the right step or on the right path. We've already been thinking about

Them: Yep.

Me: foundations. We know corporations, you know, have a different timeline, so we're sort of thinking we might turn to those next. You know, we're layering in users along the way. And here are some open questions, relationship building, etcetera. Know, we're sort of thinking that's a strand that comes in after this first push. Whatever, you know, the right framing is that obviously the the detail tails off you know, differently after three months and differently after nine months. I mean, it sort of becomes nebulous. But I don't think that you know, I think if, you know, I were coming in in a role like that, I would appreciate knowing sort of what people have been thinking, knowing where they stand, having this list of names already vetted You know, I I don't think any of that feels imposing. It's day one. You never quite know what to do anyway. It'd be great. And if we're

Them: I I would be happy. I mean,

Me: that together with your sort of there is a resource. You're the one who designed this, and she could check

Them: Yeah.

Me: to say, like, why did you do that there? Like, okay. I I feel like that's the right transition anyway. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. And and I would be just from a incoming development director role.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Would be so happy to come in and have someone say, hey. Here's 60 holy cow. This is this great. This has been because I've been in, you know, most of the places I walk into, and this is the way it happens.

Me: Let's go. Right? Right. Exactly.

Them: There's nothing. Or what there is is terrible. You know? And it's like, oh god.

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: I gotta do this whole thing.

Me: Yeah.

Them: But that that shouldn't be the case here. And Okay.

Me: Yeah. So I think that'd be useful. And

Them: So Good.

Me: you know, I don't think that that calendar needs to say, know, here's the report that Rick said you need to send on whatever. But if we know, if we've got the version that says, like, we'd sort of expect we'd get, you know, this much you know, this this kind of reporting at this point. It's what it then then, you know, I and Sue can sort of lay those expectations out for her as well. And think that's that's useful. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. Great. Sounds good. I'm curious. About how we introduce her to the PIs or keep the connection with the PIs going every week, month, whatever whatever the frequency is, I mean, we have a lot of ideas out there. It seems like most of them need to be filtered through you, Chad, just so that we prioritize the right funder with the right idea, which you could probably do more than Danielle or the PIs at this point. And maybe just going forward in general. And I don't think we've grappled yet with the structure of what that looks like.

Me: Uh\-uh.

Them: On a Rick, do you have any The only the only thing I've heard sort of along those lines, and this is just a would be a guess, would be a real small piece, is that Cynthia has mentioned there's some sort of internal newsletter document where you share stories or updates or that sort of thing. I I think that exists. Maybe it was yeah. Maybe she was hopeful to create it. I

Me: Yeah. No. That that does this, but it's

Them: don't know. That I mean, that would be a place, but

Me: I I think I think this is more sort of what conversations with

Them: yeah.

Me: happens as people are thinking about ideas and

Them: Yeah.

Me: imagining and there are different people who have different levels of excitement. Some of them ready to know, frustrated that they didn't get a list of foundations that they be calling two months ago because they've they're ready to go talk to, you know, a program office.

Them: Gotcha. I see.

Me: I'm like, yeah.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they're gonna want 14 of those 16 applications

Me: Know, but I exactly. Yeah.

Them: to be for their be theirs. Effort. Yeah. Not the

Me: Right.

Them: greedy. They're just excited. Not as familiar with with you guys, that side of it. I mean, you know, obviously, presenting this issue right now, my answer would be communication is gonna be key.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And the introduction of Danielle to them both as a group and and maybe it sounds like individually will be key. I don't know if there's a point person on staff that could kinda be the intermediary since I don't really know much of your staff be beyond this group and and Cynthia and Leslie. You know, in terms of programmatic staff. I'm probably not the best person to be the

Me: That that's fine. No. I think I think we can set up, you know, we can set up the first sort of round of conversations with her. And then, you know, I think we

Them: intermediary. Yeah.

Me: that's a piece we wanna hand off to her mostly as well so that she can develop a rhythm and, you know, and relationships with people because that's

Them: Yeah.

Me: kind of thing she should ultimately be. Doing the rounds with PRs on a regular basis and, you know, sure we're pulling her into the other conversations so she knows what people are proposing to NSF, etcetera. So Mhmm.

Them: I wonder if we could get her, like, one or two pagers from each of the p PIs about things that they're interested in in the next three years being funded, either stuff that was submitted and hasn't been funded or, you know, where it could add on to their current stream of work. Don't know.

Me: Yeah, that's definitely a good idea. People may or may not be able to think of those.

Them: Yeah. I mean, the more that you can sort of con you can you can create you know, documentation or some sort of map I would think the more Danielle is gonna be comfortable as she begins to figure out what are her buckets. Of projects and what are her buckets of funders and sort of how to mesh them together Mhmm. I do get the sense that there is some competition there.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And that's you know, I'm a leave that one to you. I mean, I'm happy to jump in. But I you know, you guys know your people better than I do.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Right. You know, that's gonna be interesting.

Me: Right.

Them: I think the answer is what is the funder? Know, what is the funder looking for? And Danielle really should own the funders and be able I think be able to be a have the authority to say, well, we're gonna take this project to this foundation, and here's why.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: You know? Know, maybe poke holes in that, but I think I think you gotta have someone who can kinda lead that process. Obviously, Chad, so you guys are gonna

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, be behind the behind the scenes sort of you know, figuring that out. But I I think Danielle should have some ownership and some authority to be able to do that. So that we're you know, so that her universe is really, you know, maybe the the deciding

Me: I think so. And it's a matter of getting her into the right conversations with people,

Them: part.

Me: that she both so that she has the relationships with them to push back or say, yeah. I know, but we're, you know, how about the next one? And so that she's got the right know, one pagers in her back pocket when we're talking about or with foundation x And they're like, yeah. And I'm also thinking about coding. She's like, well, funny you should mention that. We just talking yesterday about a great coding project, you know, kind of thing.

Them: Yes. Yep. Absolutely. Absolutely. Let me

Me: So I think the initial piece is developing those relationships with PIs and developing enough familiarity with the projects that she can, you know, also know, in the middle of the night go, wait a minute. You know, I bet and call up Jay and go, could you do this in this direction and, you know, because I bet this you know, Spencer would eat it up or, you know, whatever. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. Let me add a little bit more of that then into the,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: into the calendar and and think a little bit more about that too. To think about from Danielle's point of view.

Me: Yeah. And on the federal side, for what it's worth, you know, that you know, I think every new NSF proposal we put in probably has two or three potential foundation proposals within it. For, you know, the creative mind. So figuring out how to get her involved in that understanding what people's ideation is without getting absorbed overly absorbed in the minutiae of NSF of which there's lots.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Is another layer that's it's not we don't have to think that through. I'm just stating it out loud because it's we don't want those to be completely separate universes.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Lots of good ideas that are floating around the table and some of them get

Them: Mhmm.

Me: thrown aside because they don't fit NSF, but they could be great for somebody else. Mhmm.

Them: For for my own identification, I haven't done a ton of work with with federal funding, you know, I think I've been open about that. But also for Danielle's position, when you pull together something, let's say, for NSF, are you saying the PI also has to pull together potential foundation funding, or are you saying generally

Me: No. Not at all. Fact, it's not at all in our sphere.

Them: the work process creates

Me: So we're not thinking about that at all. But, you know, if we're like, oh, we we'll get these partners in Kentucky to do professional development for this something, and also we need other states. So how about Massachusetts and how about, you know, Wyoming? And so, like, we're all, like, putting a package together for NSF. Nobody's thinking, wait a minute. So we just got this awesome partner in Wyoming to sign on for this grant.

Them: Yes.

Me: I bet there are rich people in the Tetons, you know, who why why don't we call them

Them: I see.

Me: at the same time because they don't care if we submit it to NSF. It's still a great idea. You know? So we never think about all the exhaust that might turn into potential foundation pitch

Them: Right. Right. Right. Right. I see what you're saying. And and how many how many pitches I mean, I don't know if you can answer this, but in a typical year, and maybe back before the federal grant system looks like it looks

Me: Yeah.

Them: today. How many pitches would you guys send out in a year?

Me: And so and this half?

Them: On on average? Like, 10 or 100 or

Me: 2,000?

Them: to to federal funding sources.

Me: We we're probably involved in two two to 2,000 or three a year. And those are 15 page proposals

Them: Okay. So I wonder, is it

Me: with, you know, probably which probably means 15 to 20 different partners of different stripes you know, maybe maybe more. I don't know if you can correct me. But it's

Them: No. I think yeah.

Me: a dozen or two different partners, universities, know, professional development providers, you know, individual districts, etcetera.

Them: Well and I would say another 50% you know, half of that, that include us in their proposals, their

Me: Right.

Them: proposals. So there's some work for hire work that we can do. Okay. With our researchers or our tech group

Me: Yeah.

Them: Yeah. I wonder if there if there is there a way to sort of build into your process internally without creating a ton of work for your PIs? Every time we apply for a federal grant, we want some notes about potential

Me: Mhmm.

Them: other funders. That Danielle can look at Not that that the PI has to go do a ton of work, to create, but maybe because of their universe and and who they work with and their partners and their knowledge base and all of that, they know that. You know, you know, this particular foundation is interested in in in work in Wyoming or they see them fund work in Wyoming, I wonder if there's a way to sort of build in an internal process that just Danielle has that line of of vision, line of sight to see every time a proposal goes in. Here's some potential targets.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. I mean, I I think definitely. Well, like, I could imagine

Them: Does that make sense?

Me: every time you submit an SF proposal, you debrief, you know, the week after to sort of think about, you know, both how it went, but also, like, what came out of that that might turn into something, you know, this partner would be really great for x or y or z or this idea that we just pitched, you know, some the first year of that could be a pitch to a foundation Because by the time you're done with that process, you know, usually, we just sort of ignore it because you're exhausted. You don't wanna do it in the middle of that process. But by the end, also kinda know like, who you'd wanna work with and who you don't and which ideas you have to leave on the table, the cutting room floor that would have

Them: Yeah.

Me: be interesting or, you know, what have you. So that might be I mean, that that might be the end to end. We don't we don't debrief from that process enough because we're all exhausted. At the end of submitting something. So it'd be great to do that anyway.

Them: Right. Right. I also think this is where we need Danielle to train us as to what

Me: Yeah.

Them: know, I don't think we know how to I mean,

Me: Yeah.

Them: I don't think a lot of us know how to chunk things down into something that a foundation would be interested in. So maybe, you know, the first fall is just her talking with people about what federal proposals came in and helping people brainstorm how to make it appealing to private

Me: Mhmm.

Them: foundations. Even in our conversations with you, Rick, where I I only remember the incidents anymore, but but you know, some idea came up about something that we could pursue. And you said, you know, we could pursue that thing or we could pursue funding to pursue that thing. And we're like, oh, yeah. Okay. We don't have to do it all on the funding we have in hand. We can like, that would be a nice chunk to fundraise for so that we can then build that part out So I think it's in some ways, it's slowing ourselves down and rethinking how we're used

Me: Mhmm.

Them: to raising funds for the organization. Yeah. It sounds excellent. If we can if we can integrate something like that with the PRIs, I think that would be excellent. So the reasons we're talking about but also the the relationship building as a piece of fundraising that you know, we wanna focus on If Danielle knows again, let's go back to this project in Wyoming. That, you know, we're focused there, and we've got this great effort. We've got universities, and we've got maybe some industries or something, you know, partnering together or submitting it to NSF. She may also have awareness of a high net worth individual or a a family foundation that operates out there that she could not necessarily take and ask to, but that she could craft you know, an email or some sort of summary document

Me: Mhmm.

Them: that comes out under your signature, Chad, and say, hey. We would love to talk to you about this, but I really just wanted to make you aware because I know you focus in this field. Mhmm. Here's what we're doing. Mhmm. And that's that's a that's a really effective, strong way to build a relationship. It's not

Me: Mhmm.

Them: we need $50,000 in the next ninety days. And it's not, hey. We're submitting to your open call for funders in Wyoming.

Me: Right.

Them: It's just wanted to let you know we're doing this because I know, you know, you you you pay attention to what's going on in STEM education in Wyoming, and we we want to make you aware of I'd love to have a call you. PI would love to have a call with you. Generally, we just wanted to make you aware of it. And that is really strong relationship building. Right?

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because we're not asking for anything upfront.

Me: Right. Right. Mhmm. Yeah. No. I think that's a great idea. And, you know, we have lots of

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: I mean, we have lots of those things. We have three times as many proposals as, you or, you know, as we ever get, you know, accepted, and we've got, you know, each one of those has lots of different, you know, partners and strands. And of what we're talking about and bringing Danielle up to speed is you know, making sure she knows the ideas and the potential partners that we have that are floating around and that we're developing so that, you know, she can put two and two together and make five, you know, in some way that somebody else couldn't. And most of the time, we don't

Them: Yeah.

Me: capture that a lot of the time. A lot of that gets lost because, you know, I don't know Amy wrote and, you know, I'm working on my own thing and other yeah. But if we if I have some

Them: Right.

Me: but if, you know, we're losing that to the wind and Danielle misses the chance to mail Wyoming, then, you know, we're losing out. So I think it's definitely definitely important. And and

Them: Yeah.

Me: could be a lot can come with that.

Them: It's a great opportunity. It's a great it's a great file of

Me: Yeah. He Mhmm.

Them: you know, the potential of of rock that could turn into gold. Mhmm. Yeah. I think it's fantastic. Just gotta figure out, you know, how to how to make that happen on a regular basis. And I would assume your PIs would be interested in

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: in in entertaining that.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know? It would be a little extra work for them.

Me: Not that much, actually. I mean, like, the nice thing is that with most of these

Them: But maybe more conversation or anything. Yeah.

Me: you know like, there's a concrete a concrete event and a concrete, you know, artifact to draw If you're saying, like, I just submitted this proposal like, you submit a proposal, then once you catch your breath again, you go over it with Danielle.

Them: Yes.

Me: And you talk about the process and the people and the idea and the something, and she can ask questions. And worst case scenario, she just knows what we're submitting, but best case scenario

Them: Mhmm.

Me: she's like, oh, lots of people are doing things in Wyoming. So hey.

Them: Yes. Yeah. And I and I will say, you guys may know this already, but there are an an enormous amount of small and and I don't mean small dollar wise, but I mean sort of, like, hidden

Me: Right.

Them: community foundations that are made up of wealthy people

Me: Yeah.

Them: money. They manage wealthy wealthy people's money. And they give grants. And sometimes those wealthy people are billionaires.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: They just don't wanna have a a a home office. They wanna deal with anything of it. They love the community foundation.

Me: Yeah.

Them: That's where their billion dollars is parked, and nobody knows about it. Right? Until you actually get in that system, and the people at the community foundation know about you. The more you can make yourself in front of geographically focused community foundations the more I mean, there's an enormous amount of doors there that you can open up.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And then I wouldn't be able to tell you that the finest software in the world wouldn't be able to find for you

Me: Right.

Them: just because they're tiny and they're hit.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: They sort of wanna stay tiny in it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. So I'd I'd definitely encourage that. So let's I'll flesh that out more on terms of actual

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, what where it would fit in the calendar and what it would look like. That's that's the great idea. Right.
