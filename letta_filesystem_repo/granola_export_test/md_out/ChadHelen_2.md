Transcript:

Me: Hello? Oops. Lost the video again. Not a problem.

Them: Yeah. No. I'm coming back. Sorry.

Me: Yeah. Right. Exactly.

Them: Right. I double clicked. What? Okay. There I am.

Me: Perfect. How are doing?

Them: Good. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Me: That's not a problem.

Them: So what news?

Me: Not a ton of that's been different since the last check\-in, I guess. It's August, so things are slow and congress is out of session. We are waiting on

Them: And then as if it hasn't come through with anything further,

Me: hearing nothing new on our side, so we're continuing to wait. You know, they've they've come through with, yesterday all of the responses to everybody, it seems. Appeals to the the terminated grants, were simple letters that said, sorry. You can't do that or refused or what have you. I mean but they so

Them: Right.

Me: somebody was busy doing that. But more than that, we haven't seen. There is a page that has some status on awards, and it's been you know, they've been coming out, but not not as many since the new executive order or maybe none in in education. I don't know. That's in the last few days. So so we're continuing to hope that, you know, things continue to push through and doing the best we can to try forward.

Them: And how about the search for the

Me: So that is successful and and good.

Them: development director?

Me: We have somebody who is accepted and is starting on September 2 officially, and I'm just reaching out she should be in the office, on the Friday of the board so I'm hoping she'll be able to come in at least and pop in for fifteen minutes or so and say hello to the board on that during the call as well. Mhmm. Yes.

Them: You might send a notice to the board that you have hired somebody.

Me: Yes. No. I'm gonna put her, her CV into the the packet that I send out tomorrow.

Them: Good.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. So I wanted to just

Them: Good. And gender is all set?

Me: check with you on making sure we were on the same place. You know, board business, obviously, the bylaws and is a part of that. So I figure we should give ourselves at least a little bit of time for poor business. But probably no more than a half hour, I think. I'm I've got sort of forty five minutes for director of development foundations conversation. I haven't I haven't figured out the best balance between yeah, I I think Danielle should be there to say hello. I don't wanna put her on the spot too much because

Them: Yeah. I don't think she should be there for too long.

Me: exactly. Because it's just you know, she hasn't even started yet, but but she should at least wave Rick has obviously been involved with us for a while as well. I don't I don't think it's too awkward, but it's also complicated if they're both there at the same time. So or

Them: I think it's

Me: I don't know that he needs to be there, really.

Them: different not.

Me: Yeah.

Them: We thought we had break at the last meeting. I don't

Me: Exactly. I'm gonna check\-in. We didn't have him in a meeting, but I don't know if that's important necessarily.

Them: need to see Yeah.

Me: I think Ron and I can can describe and Sue describe what we've done with Rick to get things ready.

Them: Process and how you got to where you are.

Me: Exactly. Yep. Mhmm. Yep. I think that's that's what I was imagining.

Them: And invite her in just to say hello and

Me: I'll, you know, I'll have a brief update to we'll have a finance info. She's on vacation this week, so her finance piece will come a little bit later on Monday or so. But it'll be you know, all of this will be relatively brief. She's got about a one or one page or so And then the two things that I think are newish to people that are worth knowing about, but I don't know that they're big discussion points. So I kind of was lumping them together is, I mentioned the licensing question. Which I think is important for the board to have on its mind. I don't know that there's a lot of I don't think there's a big discussion or sort of decision to be made right now, but I think the board should know that we're talking about licensing with regard to people who make money not necessarily getting our stuff for free. Exactly.

Them: Publishing this address.

Me: And that and that there is a brand, you know, brand promise and sort of reputation associated with free, and we're weighing those pieces together. And the other the other piece that they should know about is that we're trying to put a big emphasis toward understanding users and having focus groups and things of different types of types of users over the next six to nine months. I can report on some of the things that we're doing on that so far and what we're planning. And I'd be interested in, you know, people's takes on either connections for that or advice. I kinda feel like those two together might be forty five minutes at most, and if we have executive session, then we pretty much taken up the time there.

Them: Okay. The other thing I would like to see in your reporting is an update on the status of CODAP.

Me: Yes. Exactly. And I'll have that in the CEO update, and I can speak to it there. We have a beta that is open by invite, and we're getting input from people on it at present. So we've got it open to people, and should have the you know, that's sort of helping us determine anything that's critical as we're that more and more public over the next month or two. This is go grant just launched our we had a kickoff meeting today. For the planning grant for Cisco that was awarded about a month ago. So I can report on that as well. I think people will be

Them: Good.

Me: happy to know both of those are moving forward

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Some little. It doesn't have to be long, but it definitely needs to be there. Where are we now?

Me: Oh, yeah. Yep. No question. Mhmm.

Them: And what's the path Maybe thinking about how CodeApp links into licensing and into

Me: Mhmm.

Them: fundraising. I Is it is it kind of a lead thing in what we're looking at?

Me: Yeah. I think in that conversation,

Them: Or is it just one of many?

Me: of the products code app, the the Clue framework is another example, are that might be productized. And there are other cases where there are libraries of materials that for groups

Them: Collections. The science is collection or whatever.

Me: you know, are of interest. Exactly and for for teachers are, you know, we we want them to be free in the right ways for the right people. But cut out might have a layer to it that people would pay for as a product, and we have to explore that, for example. Mhmm.

Them: Yes. And and there might be licensing

Me: Right.

Them: it to be included as a tool in in a curriculum.

Me: Mhmm. Exactly. Yep. Yeah. So I think that conversation, I can provide a sort of one pager or half pager that lays out each one. And for that one, I can describe some of the some of the questions that are underlying that licensing layer of what are the things that licensing do we need to determine.

Them: Well, I think as much as you can, describe the status of where your thinking is and what are specific questions that you think board input would be valuable on?

Me: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: Right? I mean, you're thinking about it

Me: Mhmm.

Them: so we should know what you've been thinking

Me: Right. Right. Exactly. Yep.

Them: We try to answer the questions assuming you don't know anything.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: So

Me: Yep.

Them: some information as to where you stand and then questions, I think.

Me: Yeah. That would that was fine. My expectation as well.

Them: In head.

Me: And then I figure a half hour executive session, does that seem about right?

Them: Good. Yes. I think

Me: Yeah.

Them: that right.

Me: So so, yeah, I'll put those together. We'll send the main packet out tomorrow, probably by end of day. Yeah.

Them: And the it will include the two options for what we do with book

Me: Exact. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. That'll be part of that.

Them: with bylaw.

Me: And then Sue will have a finance piece that come will come as soon as she comes back early next week.

Them: Right. Your package should say that's coming

Me: Yep. Exactly. Mhmm.

Them: Where's the finance piece?

Me: Yes. Right? Yeah.

Them: Because critical to know where we stand financially too.

Me: Yep. Exactly. Yeah. Right. I mean, it's

Them: Not great.

Me: ambiguous, and the ambiguity at this point is not what we want. But yeah, we're hoping hoping things fall on the positive side as much as they seem like they're would normally be. There's no normal right now. So

Them: It's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: Right? I I have a feeling the the grand situation will not go anywhere near as positively as you think it might. So

Me: Yeah. I'm not sure. I I agree. I mean, they've definitely been awarding things, but, know what's gonna happen when it comes down to to crunch time or

Them: yeah.

Me: happening right now as opposed to last week. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. Exactly. It's just

Me: Yeah. No. There's no question about that.

Them: so crazy. Every time you think things are moving back to some kind of reasonable process,

Me: Right.

Them: another executive order comes out and

Me: Right.

Them: everybody's scurrying around trying to figure out what that one means.

Me: Exactly. Yeah.

Them: Really a weird world about living

Me: Is entirely

Them: So, okay, so you get those that stuff out. Doesn't sound as if there'll really be time for me to look at

Me: I

Them: the packet anyway before

Me: I didn't fix so, but I I don't think it'll be, you know, highly controversial

Them: everyone and It's it's

Me: It's fairly it'll be fairly slim, especially since, you know, at least some people have been at the updates, we've been

Them: necessary.

Me: sending out updates every month or three weeks already. So Mhmm. He's

Them: Right. So people know know what has been happening in major

Me: Yeah.

Them: stroke. So

Me: Yeah. Exactly.

Them: Just trying to make it as explicit as possible where we are and and I think the financial piece, people will wanna discuss

Me: Mhmm.

Them: well, what ifs to something. On the negative side. When do we say

Me: Five.

Them: this is impossible? You know, something the board has to think about.

Me: Yep.

Them: And

Me: Yeah. I mean, the the adjustments that we've made

Them: give us a

Me: you know, we made assuming no federal funding. So we're still, you know, in a place where we, you know,

Them: Yes.

Me: can default to that as needed. And, know, and hope that it's better than that and I think I think it'll be better than that in some way, shape, or form and could be, you know, decently better than that for sure. I guess that's true. Exactly. Yes. It's

Them: Well, it's slightly better already with the Cisco.

Me: tiny, but we'll take it.

Them: Tiny little thing.

Me: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: But everything else is still up in the air.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: So frustrating. I I hope you're staying mentally sane.

Me: I am. I mean, I think, I mean, I think these things being in questions is is firm as you can get with NSF in general. It's more it's more a timing and sort of nail biting thing at this point. And that

Them: Right.

Me: was I think, an open question as the next few weeks roll along. But Alright.

Them: Well, good.

Me: Yep. I think so. I'll report on it then.

Them: It's best we can do, and you can

Me: High level. Okay.

Them: I don't have anything else I've been thinking about that I need to say to you? So

Me: That's great. Well, I'll send stuff along. If I've got questions, I'll ping you by text, but I think it'll be fairly straightforward and

Them: Yeah. I'll I'll be on the road for a few days because

Me: Okay.

Them: taking granddaughter to college, but

Me: Right. Alright.

Them: it's just mainly over the next weekend. So

Me: Sounds good. Very good. I'll I'll see you Friday and virtually before and via text or email if we need to.

Them: Yes.

Me: Alright. Take care. Bye.

Them: Okay. Wonder Bye.
