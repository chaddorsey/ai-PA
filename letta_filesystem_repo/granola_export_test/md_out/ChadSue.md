So I thought I was trying to send my thank you, but please keep giving note to the board along with notice about the proposals. It was overdue because I told them or the grant because I told them I'd keep them up to date on the awards that we were getting and hadn't yet. So Them: Oh, good. Me: check it off the box to check the box off on that. Them: Yeah. Me: Alright. So hello. Hello. Them: I I have a lot that you don't know about already. I mean, I think we at some point, Me: Yes. Them: we need to meet with Kathy. Me: Exactly. I agree. When I think Them: Anyway, Me: I think today is helping solidify our policies if nothing else, policy by deadline. I mean, I think and I think that could work to say like, on the one on the sort of agreement side, like, we're you know, we've been happy to be at home for this. We, you know, to express coming in that we couldn't you know, support more on this and, you know, are happy to support it if something happens in another organization. And as a temporary employee, there are you know, we've been establishing the policies around you know, going forward around temporary employees and this, you know, these things don't fit under that as well. I mean, essentially trying to make it clear that I think some of these other layers, I think, you know, whether it's you know, by convenience or not, you know, the all hands meeting maybe and picture and some of those kinds of things. They're like, okay. For now, if we've got sort of a a different class, of employee, that's okay with me for the the time being, I guess. Them: I think yeah. I agree. I we should codify this more so we don't forget ourselves what we're doing. But Me: Yeah. Them: I think I do think that even temporary employees should go to all hands I think it is important to hear what's happening just in the organization. We're going to forget Me: Mhmm. Yeah. Them: some people aren't at all hands. I think it's fine to not have her. Me: Yeah. Them: This one, she may not Me: Right. Exactly. Yep. Them: get there anyway. I yeah. I I think with Kathy, it's just the clarity around the language. Me: I know. Totally. Yep. Them: Even if she is written in by someone else at a different institution, she first of all, we should know about it. But second of all, she can't even accept it under Me: Right. Them: Concord So yeah. Okay. Me: Right. Mhmm. Mhmm. I agree. You know? So Them: A Me: writing that out as a paragraph of talking points and events and then having that paragraph to send as an email probably is the Them: Yeah. Okay. That sounds good. Oh, I'm taking Granola now. Me: definitely the thing we need to do. Them: I don't need to write this. Me: That's fine. Them: Okay. Good. So, let me just write up that email. It doesn't seem like much more language than we've already Me: Yep. Them: Slacked each other. And, Me: Mhmm. Them: and so we'll hold it. And then I'll find a time to meet Me: Okay. Them: you and me and Kathy about that. And sooner rather than later just because I think we need to deliver the message on the Me: Yes. Yes. Exactly. Well, and I'm I've been, you know, holding off entering on the supplemental side as well because she sent me by all possible channels, you know, questions the other day about the supplemental and I, you know, just held because I thought we were meeting today. But Them: Yeah. Well, that was the Me: same same story there. Them: that was really the reason of our meeting today, but it'll probably come up in the Me: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. Them: and if I've you know? I probably just I'm gonna have to tell her it's Me: Yeah. That's fine. I can reinforce it when we meet next Them: not gonna happen, but Me: time. Yeah. Them: but, yeah, having, you know, double down on that by you and I at a different time, I haven't really wanted to do it Me: Yeah. Them: in front of Lisa, although Me: I know. Yeah. Them: Lisa's obviously as aware as anyone and Kathy. Yeah. Me: Mhmm. Them: This seems like something. Me: Yeah. Them: Better done. Me: Mean, you can you can just mean, you can say as simple as you want that. You know? Well, I don't know. We wanna be clear and consistent with her too. So so, yeah, I mean, the supplemental side, I'm taking stock. We're being careful or whatever, but that's not the answer for her. The answer for her is Them: Yeah. Me: no because you're a temporary employee. So mhmm. Them: Yeah. Then we made this clear. When you came in. Me: Yeah. Them: Or we or we thought we made it clear. Me: We thought we did. We probably didn't. But, you know, whatever. Them: I remember making it clear because I remember saying like, we just, we you know, just trying to feed our own something. And then I remember thinking afterwards at the end, like, oh, that was a tactless as you could say it. But but I do, you know, I do remember it. Me: I think we have to be cold and cold and clear and Them: Yeah. Me: you know, kind at the same time. Yeah. Them: Okay. Me: Alright. Them: Well, that's that's for a different time. Me: Yep. Exactly. Them: I am doing what I think I'm supposed be doing, which is accounting and then my grand answers went out on Monday. Now I sent them an email and copied you and Lisa. I haven't heard anything from them, so I'll on Friday. Cathy, we just talked about I did wanna remind you that I you know, made these multiyear projections if you hadn't seen them should be able to click through to them. Me: Right. Yes, I did look at this. Before the other meeting. I think it's useful Them: Yeah. I mean, the the you know, the bottom line is that I think the bottom line for me is that staff reductions are gonna have to go into Me: Mhmm. Them: effect October 1\. Even if we get all these award letters in, there will still be some people that will have to reduce their time. It doesn't save everyone, so I want to make that clear Me: Okay. That's good to to know as well. It's not, that's not totally clear Them: Yeah. Me: you from this. It's hard to sort of tell. Them: Yeah. From the I mean, the problem is I just lump them all together. Me: Right. Them: And, of course, it depend you know, his son's gonna have a Me: Of course. Right. Them: position if his son's grants get funded. And, know, like, it's it's Me: Right. Yeah. Them: a hodgepodge. And and to be honest, it's really the tech group that's that that continues to be the most fragile in this. Me: Mhmm. Them: So I think I I feel like the message at all hands is we are taking a run from every angle we see viable right now. Me: Mhmm. Them: On revenue. But you know, we we you know? And we're recommended on these six proposals while now five because when through the door. But Me: You know. Them: right now, don't have the money in hand. We're looking at Me: Mhmm. Them: staff reductions on October 1\. Even if we get all of these proposals awarded Me: Right. Them: there will still be some not staff reduction, but FTE reduction. Me: Right. We even even getting all these awards doesn't fill us up for next year, and we're gonna have to Them: Yep. Yep. But we Me: account for that. Mhmm. Them: but, I mean, I think the only, like, assurance we can give is that we're working really, really hard Me: Mhmm. Them: to try to get everyone up to full employment as quickly as possible, but Me: Mhmm. Them: the but what we have right now isn't Me: Mhmm. Them: gonna do it. Me: Yeah. I think that's the right way to say it and to be optimistic and sobering at the same time. And to make it clear that we're there's lots of opportunity to dig in and work. Them: Mhmm. Me: For everybody, including Danielle and and all the above. And not that we're necessarily putting the grid of proposals up but can refer to the fact that we had a big proposal meeting earlier this week You know, we're talking with Them: Mhmm. Me: anybody and everybody, you know, and you know, who knows anybody and trying to think about the the right ideas and the right somethings and there'll be lots of people there are lots of opportunities, and there'll be lots of people you know, writing for proposals that we're used to And I interviewed Danielle, Them: Yes. Me: lots of things we're not used to as new opportunities as well. Them: And we had you know, in some way, I don't know if you can wrap it in, but we have heard a lot of people Me: Right. Them: wanna help. They really wanna help. And here's Me: Mhmm. Them: here's your opportunity to help you know, We may be tapping people that don't normally tap or, you know, whatever to just pitch Me: Mhmm. Them: in and write read Me: Mhmm. Yep. Them: whatever for us. Me: Yeah. I think that's I think that's right. And I'm just trying to make that as clear as we can. And then dig in. Yeah. Them: Yeah. Okay. Alright. Judy and I well, I know you had a meeting with Julie Judy, earlier today. Right? Me: Yeah. We didn't Them: Or Me: didn't do too much. Them: she has been digging into the workforce Me: Oh, right. Yeah. She told me about that. Them: for for a Massachusetts thing. Yeah. So she's a Me: Mhmm. Them: put in the application for that. So between that and how people use their vacation days and what does it mean for me to reduce time starting October 1? Judy and I agreed today that we'd have Me: Yep. Them: we'd set up two information sessions at the September, so we'll do that. Me: Mhmm. Yeah. That's right. And Them: And and this is way to try to get questions out of all hands and into either one on ones or these information sessions. So Me: Yep. Yeah. And we'd said that we'd see she is gonna announce general HR ish, other kinds of things, and I'd I figured you could help reinforce and mention that those sessions were happening. Didn't need to mention more than that, but just that we will have Them: Mhmm. Me: couple sessions about these and one for Massachusetts people, who, you know, to understand where work share stuff is applicable. And another just in general for folks who Them: Yep. Yep. Me: are changing their FTE. Them: Yeah. Okay. Anything else that should come from me? Me: I don't know. That does that is you right. I mean, are there other things Them: Anything that should come from? Me: that we need to say, want to say? I mean, I think from my side, the high level story that you were describing is the right one. And more than that, yeah, I don't know what more there is about finances on the organizational outlook side. That's important for people to know. Besides we gotta dig in. And then there's probably the other usual sort of what what we're up to stuff. Them: Yeah. We've got fiscal year end and send in year Me: But I don't know what what you thought. Right. Them: travel report and blah blah blah. Yeah. Me: Mhmm. Yep. Them: Okay. Me: Exactly. Yeah. So I don't have Them: Okay. Alright. Me: big things beyond that, I guess. Them: Okay. Me: Yeah. Okay. Them: That's all the stuff that's top of mind. Me: Alright. Yeah. I That probably is for me too. Let me see if I had notes and things. No. None of those. No, but for two minutes, I'm just chasing down my understanding As you were poking through granola, was that shared folders? Was that the real upshot or was there more that you were finding? I was poking through mine and Judy just to make sure there wasn't something else that we were not aware of that people were sharing indiscriminately. Them: So when I noticed that yesterday, I then I went into my sharing capability, and I think I, like, pulled like, all the stuff that I was sharing, I pulled it all back Me: Uh\-huh. Them: just, you know, Me: Had you been share had you been sharing by default or sharing it to Them: just Me: folders, or or do you know exactly how that happened? How what was happening? Okay. Them: I don't know. I don't know. I I noticed that all of my stuff wasn't shared, but I you know? Me: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Them: Say stuff about Kathy. I'm like, oh god. Me: Totally. Them: What if she was looking? So so I just Me: Yeah. No. It's it's a fair question. I I was just wondering Them: yeah. Me: if there was something blanket that you noticed or Them: No. I haven't gone back to Me: I mean, I think the main thing that happens is if you consciously share a note or a link, have a choice about to whom and if you make a folder that folder can be shared with the whole organization and then discoverable or shared with just the people who are invited to it, they can have zero extra invitees or many, depending upon that. There are folders that I made in experiments that I added some strategy conversations and things to for the group And so there are definitely some folders that you are a part of. That have shared notes from other people. But more than that, Them: I didn't Me: I'm not sure. You can Them: yeah. I so I didn't go back to granola and, Me: That's Them: really examine it after your message this morning. Me: that's fine. Yep. Yeah. No. I was just wondering if that was like you're like, oh, and I hit this magic button that was, show me everything or something. Them: I did I did look I did a brief look and okay. Where else are there notes about Kathy or notes about staffing, or did Judy have stuff shared that she shouldn't have you know, that I kinda poked Me: Mhmm. Them: around then, and I didn't find anything that wasn't Me: Yeah, and I'm not seeing, at least in the first page, you can go to a person and you can go to my notes and all notes and toggle back and forth and see if the notes associated with that person are different than my notes associated with that person, which would be things that they're shared. Shared. And I don't see 25 notes that show up with Brau, and then I don't see anything that shows up That's not just my notes. Them: Okay. Me: You in some way or another. So it's not that that in the last week or two you've been indiscriminately sharing 17 notes that don't know about, to me at least. Them: Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, I'm just now that I know that Me: Alright. Good to know. Exactly. Yeah. It's the usual mode with any anything, knowing that you're sharing your whole life to the world without realizing it. Is the standard mode of these platforms. Them: I know. It's great. It's gotta be Me: Yeah. Them: now. I my head's just not quite there yet. Me: That's fine. Them: Yeah. And I'm used to Me: Exactly. Them: mean, you know, mean, the conversations that we have, right, You know? The reason why we have them together is because we don't want, like, Me: Exactly. Nope. That's all good. Them: everyone Me: Yep. Them: let them. Yeah. Me: Yep. Them: But I do think just the general, like, idea of having InSource or someone do like clean up your little privacy house or Me: Yeah. Yeah. If there if there's Them: whatever makes a lot of sense. Me: if there's new stuff to be to be learned or useful stuff to be reminded, I think definitely, you know, I think dragging people through the mud unless it's checking off a cybersecurity, you know, box is you know, less important, but we should figure out what the agenda could be and make sure. And if it can be valuable, that'd be great. Them: Yeah. I don't think it needs to be open to everyone who Me: Yeah. Them: you know, are, like, forced on Me: Group mandatory. Is that right? Them: everyone. I know. But, you know, then we have enough new people like Danielle or Aditi or Me: Mhmm. Yep. Mhmm. Them: people like that who don't know about one password and things like that. So Me: Yeah. Well and there are some nuanced things like what Them: you know, there's a bunch of stuff we do. Mhmm. Me: shared drives really are or what have you. That are worth people may not realize the nuances there. Them: Yeah. Right. Exactly. Good. Me: So yeah. Okay. Them: Alright. Me: Alright. That sounds good. I did share the agenda, so feel free to add things to it if you want. Them: Oh, for all hands. Me: And we'll see you there. All hands. Yeah. I'd sure to Them: Oh, I've got a bunch of stuff in there. Me: you know, Google, but, you should have it as well, think. Yeah. Them: And in Google Drive in Drive. Me: Exactly. Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think everyone's been dumping a bunch of stuff in there since. Me: Okay. Great. Just making sure that people have it. Excellent. Yeah. I didn't know if it had gotten out because it was a a new document. But, yes, the word is in there now. That's great. Them: Yeah. I think we're gonna exceed our Me: Okay. That's alright. We'll do what we need to do. Them: forty five minutes. Okay. Me: Mhmm. Okay. Very good. See you then. Them: Alright. Take care, Chad. Thank you. Bye. Me: Bye.
