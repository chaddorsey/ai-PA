Transcript:

Me: Sorry. Keep

Them: How are you?

Me: waiting. Fine. Making sure I didn't miss an email in the background. Alright. Alright. Perfect. Yes. How are you?

Them: I'm okay.

Me: Okay.

Them: How are you?

Me: Fine.

Them: Good.

Me: As fine as I can be.

Them: Done.

Me: Yep.

Them: We're done.

Me: Alright. All good.

Them: I don't even have an agenda.

Me: Okay.

Them: But I'm sure give me 45 and I can think of some I'm gonna just

Me: But I know. Exactly. We can think of stuff to talk about. No question. Yes. And

Them: Awesome.

Me: for dealing with Kathy. I appreciate that. I I saw lots of emails, and ignored lots of emails, and I was like, I'm

Them: Yeah.

Me: I know not doing something is doing something to somebody else here. And

Them: Well, like I said, yeah, we can start with that because like I said, we're hitting the end of what where I can be useful.

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: We already passed the end of my limit. Now we're hitting the end to where I can be used.

Me: Right. Exactly. Yep. Oh, yeah. A question.

Them: Mean, although it's it's it is the gift that keeps on giving, and it I know I just had that conversation with about but I thought we were paying directly. Thinks we're paying you know, no money has gone out, but it just it just it's like this constant

Me: Crazy. Okay.

Them: whatever. Anyway, yeah, I feel I feel like we need a, work plan and although I sketched that out for you and you seemed you know, in general okay with it, I I think that

Me: Need to nail nail things down pretty

Them: yeah.

Me: solidly to make things not go crazy.

Them: I think I think it's telling Kathy, like, to her face, like, yes. That makes sense. No. That doesn't make sense. The evaluator thing, I think she I don't know enough about it. She doesn't know enough about it. So like, getting an opinion from someone like you who's been through this before and understands.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: You know, if if there is, you know, did did they really want evaluation? Did we really need one in the eleventh hour? All of that stuff.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: I don't necessarily I think that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: she really is leaning towards some code app PD

Me: Mhmm.

Them: footprint for Concord, which is great. MIT, fine. Turk will figure it out. I I have a meeting with their CFO on Monday, supposed to be today, but it got moved to Monday. So I think, you know, I'll talking on these sort of back channels will help a bit. And then a CERN they're just they're just, they already sent a bill for the for all of their expenses even though we didn't have a contract. Or, you know, they're like, oh, great. Glad the good luck the project's ending. We're done. Here's our bill. You know? Thanks lot. And the the man is a very, difficult argumentative. Luke is is, argumentative. Difficult. But I think and, you know, since they own Scoutlier and all the material is being delivered on Scoutlier,

Me: Yeah.

Them: That one's just we're just going to have to

Me: Yeah.

Them: tease that one out. I mean, I think what we can say is know, it's nice that you sent us a bill, but we didn't ask for any services. So, like and we don't have a contract with you. And you know, we we now have another year and don't have to do anything but offer this through Scoutlier through

Me: Mhmm.

Them: May, June, whatever, 2026, and then we can send you a bill for that. And, you know, Kathy's Kathy's frustrated because she sees other people being paid, and she wasn't paid during that interim. And she she's also of course, muddied the waters by saying you know, yeah, the project's not paying for things, but can you just step in and attend this meeting? Because I'm in the

Me: Right.

Them: hospital with the various and, you know, she keeps sending me back

Me: Mhmm.

Them: She's like, I I thought they were doing it out of the goodness of their heart. Oh my god. You know, I so appreciate that you were born yesterday.

Me: Right. Uh\-huh.

Them: But it's really it's difficult. So

Me: Yes. Oh my god.

Them: so I can continue working on the, like, financial, logistic consulting side of it. All I really need is for you to talk with her about, like, the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: what makes sense going forward.

Me: And it sounds like it sounds like we've got so if we didn't get the participant support, back is there any space for anybody besides Kathy to be on this, or is it helping Kathy figure out how she winds down her time And if we do get the participant support, it's different or what trying to think about, you know, how to involve anybody else in the equation or the consideration.

Them: Yeah. So if we do get, so right now, it's budgeted 70% Kathy, 10% someone else with a Cynthia salary as someone else. Some of that will need to go to, communication stuff. But we could have someone on for a smaller amount of time. I'm not know, I'm only charging overhead for the work that I'm doing. We if we wanna go with the plan that I think makes sense since there's no one really running this project in the school system in the fall extended through to the spring. And we don't get the participant support, thing change, we're going to have to somehow

Me: Right.

Them: eke out that time for, you know, so instead of 70%, she's 50% or some such thing will have to happen. And then I think we just leave part participants more money on the table and be like, we couldn't spend it, and that's it. We're not gonna

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: try to make this longer. If it's if they are willing if NSF is willing to shift participant support to salary support, The I know that there's some room for

Me: Alright. Like, ten ten minutes of time for Kate and Dan?

Them: yeah, but for like a Kathy or a Dan, which is whom she really wants

Me: Essentially. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: on the project to help her out with these

Me: Mhmm.

Them: artifacts that she's thinking.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: She is interested in getting rid of Turk Oh, and the other and the other thing is I think we should just scope Turk down to

Me: Yeah,

Them: don't think we should screw them, but we should scope them down and,

Me: Mhmm.

Them: get them get some work product out of them. And so, hopefully, there might be some cost savings there and then we could have more help. I think she would like I know she would like a researcher on our end because I think that she she she just doesn't seem that familiar with, like, the NSF research, and I think

Me: Right.

Them: she would it seems like Turk has been, like, you don't understand this. Don't don't worry yourself about it. And I think a CERN has been like, you don't understand this. Don't worry about it. And I think she needs someone on the side of the fence to say, they're right or they're being mean or something in between.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Because she just seems very at sea and a lot of

Me: Mhmm.

Them: these, issues. It seems to me like they're

Me: Yeah.

Them: they're being jerks.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I think they're and and I think they're I mean, the the

Them: And

Me: they're inexperienced on their sides as well, so it's the worst of both worlds.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And that they're, you know, putting up a fuss in in immature, you know, ways and and you know, ask for things that, yeah, maybe, you know, the nuances are but nuances might not be right either. Right? You probably don't need to do research

Them: Mhmm.

Me: exactly in that way or the something or so.

Them: Yeah. I think and

Me: A lot less people who don't get it and stumbled into an award.

Them: there's she seems to say that Turk keeps turning to her and saying, like, but what's the research question? What's the research question? And I said, we've got a research questions in your proposal? Like, are you know? And she

Me: Right.

Them: sort of vague about that. We don't go back and look at the proposal. But

Me: Yeah.

Them: it seems weird that in the eleventh hour, they're still asking what the that the researcher is asking what the I don't you know? Again, this is

Me: Yeah. Right.

Them: out of my depth too.

Me: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: But it but it's but it's all to say that if there was a team three years ago, it's not a team now.

Me: Yeah. No question. I don't think there ever was. It's definitely not. Yeah. No. We just need to get

Them: They're very much at odds. Yeah.

Me: So we need to cut ties as much as we can and and, you know,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: scope out what everybody has to do, if anything. And figure out what's left and then make something of the last year. And I feel like some version of a document process code app related something would be, you know, would be great. It's knowing that she's warming up to that is good. Even if it's even if we only have, you know, twenty minutes of time for somebody to make it, it's better than nothing. And maybe we can augment it with something, you know, a little here or there if we feel like it's actually going toward core.pd or something else, there might some ways to justify that. Let's see what this what this plays out to first. I mean, my

Them: Well,

Me: inclination would be to have that indicate both

Them: yeah. Mhmm.

Me: in some ways you perform connected to it. That might be a recipe for you know, complication or running things down. Kate certainly knows research well enough to at least

Them: Mhmm.

Me: speak to what's going on there. So

Them: Oh, well, that that would be

Me: and Kate would love to do this. You know, she's been wanting to make

Them: great.

Me: code app, you know, something for a while, of course, or whatever, or BD or so. And she could help do that sort of thing.

Them: Yeah. Well, Kathy did name her as someone that she was really interested in

Me: Effective. Too. Mhmm.

Them: working with. We would have to tell Kate not to get her excited about follow on proposals or anything

Me: Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

Them: like that. There's some real

Me: Mhmm.

Them: guardrails on this one. And,

Me: And Dan as well, of course. Yeah.

Them: yeah. Dan's yeah.

Me: Yeah.

Them: And Kate's gonna have mean, a Kathy's going have a lot of time this fall because there really isn't much then to do.

Me: Right. Right. And, of course, the the downside of her being only whatever percent is that she's got the rest of her time to do this, to to worry about this too. I mean, she may may only been paid for 50%. It doesn't mean she's not spending a 120% of her nighttime hours turning up some other problem. Mhmm.

Them: Oh, this oh, yeah. This is gonna be

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I think I think finding some way to really scope whatever, you somebody else besides Kathy is involved in and having them just stick to that. Like, everybody sticks to the knitting that we define really carefully, including people

Them: Mhmm.

Me: internally. And you know, she can say what she wants, but, like, like, we're we've defined this thing so tightly that doesn't matter if you're off dancing in the corner. You know, I'm just making this, you know, three day thing. Right? Or a three day cod up thing, three day cod up thing, whatever.

Them: Yeah. Well, both Kate and Dan have time on that Valhalla DSR grant. I don't know if their time is tightly

Me: No. It's it's not. I mean, I so I think that there's I think there could

Them: scoped, but it seems like we could pair the two Okay.

Me: very well be, you know, overlap, like I said. So as long as we're not burning things down to try to tilt it to some crazy paradigm, that Kathy is only useful for Kathy's grant or something like that. But

Them: Right. Right. Or they could be doing it. She could be modifying it in some way for

Me: but

Them: yeah, we wouldn't want her to modify it so much that it's useless. But, yeah, I know what you mean.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Yeah.

Me: I mean, if they're they're, yeah, if they're doing it anyway, if, like, if the the edict for doing it comes from something else, might be even more reason to stick to the, you know, stick to the script.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Yep. Yep.

Me: Yeah. No. That's definitely interesting.

Them: So so

Me: So timing. Yeah. So

Them: next steps. On this one.

Me: I can talk to Kathy whenever. Of course, the you know, nice caveats are that I'm working on a proposal in theory. That's due next Friday, in fact, But but probably sooner rather than later is gonna be important.

Them: Yeah. She

Me: Oh, already is. Yes. Of course.

Them: she is 70% done with not a lot of stuff to do.

Me: So so I should find a time to talk to her on next Monday or Tuesday at the worst, probably Monday.

Them: Well and I I do feel like it'd be helpful if I join that conversation

Me: That's fine. Yep. That's I totally agree as a handoff and to to reinforce. What we think is going on there.

Them: Yeah. Let's let's let's be clear. There's no handoff here. There's just

Me: Yeah. I know. I agree. Yes.

Them: reinforcing

Me: To bring me in Let's see. I put in source token. I could meet before you meet with Charlene. Like, 11:30, 11:15\.

Them: Yeah. You know,

Me: I mean, conversations expand to fill beyond so maybe it's 11:15 to 11:45 and we know it's gonna go till noon or something. I know. What were you gonna say?

Them: Oh, what was I gonna say? Yeah. Like, I'm I'm you're right. I mean, the it expands, and I and I needed to stop expanded. I I think it's almost better that it goes from 11:30 to twelve and we

Me: Right.

Them: say we have a hard cutoff at twelve.

Me: I think so. Yeah. Right. I mean, let's we'll take notes on anything that we

Them: And

Me: you know, that we need to talk about after that. But

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, we can follow\-up later or something. But Mhmm.

Them: But I can you know what I've been doing? I I have, these these Google Docs now with every, like, iteration of what's happening, and to dos. So I think I'm not gonna have time to do this, but but maybe can help me, like, sketch out a you know, where we are now a plan. The broad brush of what I think DAISY's gonna look like in for the next nine months, and then we can you can say yes or say no or fill in the details no to the evaluator, yes to this, whatever. Go forward with the participant support request. And we'll we'll just have a game plan that we can go forward with.

Me: I think so. Yeah. And And I think it might be as as a three bullet version of what you were just describing from the here's where the project logistics stand and

Them: Yeah.

Me: little version of what I pasted in Slack about, like, here here are my thoughts on, like, going in with takeaways, I think, is

Them: Yep.

Me: know, one of the one strategy to say, like, just we're verifying that we're all on the same page about these six things. And next up, I'm gonna talk to Dan and Kate and we'll have a meeting next week or something like that. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I I think that's perfect, and I'll and I'll share it with you and Kathy early and say if she needs to add anything to this

Me: Yep.

Them: agenda that we'll now call it She should do it now because we only have a half hour We we wanna do it sooner rather than later, but we only have a half hour. So

Me: Yep. I agree.

Them: Okay.

Me: Okay. I am making that meeting right now. The

Them: Alright.

Me: Okay. Great.

Them: Okay. Here's oh, awesome. Thank you. I have you know, I've been doing some bigger thinking about Judy leaving, and Judy's gonna start thinking about that with me too. And then we can have a I think we can have a conversation It's not this FTE review on Monday because that's coming up really fast, but maybe the start of that conversation at that FTE review.

Me: Mhmm. Yeah. She mentioned to me earlier that she's been thinking about the stuff too and reiterate what you know, which is that she's, you know, helping develop a handoff and also not evaporating on January 1\. So

Them: Yeah.

Me: makes sense makes sense. Mhmm.

Them: I I think that, in one haven't a lot of things haven't built in, but one of them, there's just stuff that there's tasks that not getting picked up Haven't really gotten picked up since Denise and Rebecca left.

Me: Right.

Them: Some of them, we don't need to pick up other things. We really do need to address one of the big things is that, if I get hit by a bus, it's some of some there's not a lot of overlap.

Me: Right.

Them: Anymore.

Me: Yeah. We don't have two other people who are here and know the processes of them. Mhmm.

Them: And Yeah. They know generally that there's something in a file somewhere, and they can bring it up and you know, I started training Lisa on some of it in source should just know some of it, but it's also not well documented. So

Me: That's a good point.

Them: so I think built into this should be some thinking about where the overlap needs to be.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Anything I should know about board stuff? Talking to the

Me: I don't think so. I had a meeting with Helen earlier this week, and it was

Them: board.

Me: you know, pretty pro form a. She had read the stuff that day and said, looks like you got good stuff and there's good questions to be had there. She was prompting me to think about what you know, when board asks me how involved I am in foundation stuff or some proposal writing, you know, to have an answer there. That was one thing she thought people would ask about. She mentioned in the past that, you know, we and she was sort of acknowledging to you that we haven't done anything with the getting ready to, like, inventorying our assets or talking to other companies or whatever and, you know, wanting to have an answer for that.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And, you know, yeah, pretty much we have them, and I can do a little bit in the background tonight and just say that I've, you know, done some thinking about it, but I'm not gonna pretend that we've been having those. And I think it's just I think the sense it shifted, you know, enough that it didn't make sense start those conversations and at the same time, we're we do know that we've got some people available for them. We're going to talk with explore learning coming up in, you know, a month or two because we started in the summer and they had to put it off. So we're not not not having these conversations, and we're talking to other nonprofits, etcetera. Those are the only things that she brought up as, you know, open questions. I mean, people will look at the KPIs as well. Sort of hard to interpret because there's in between that together with the numbers. You know, let's just says it's complicated, I guess. I don't know what story to tell besides that. I mean, Helen is a little bit more pessimistic, in a negative way, but sort of saying, things aren't guaranteed. And I'm like, yeah, well, but they're often good. And don't know. And by the minute, I feel either way. So

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I'm not sure that there's a unified, you know, sunny or cloudy message to bring to the board in that we wanna bring them more ambiguity, but but not trying to cover anything over. I mean, we're in a world of ambiguity.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. That's a that makes sense to me. I I got a Slack message from Jay saying, that started with, you know, well, now that our financial concerns are over, and I thought, oh, oh my.

Me: That's interesting.

Them: Yeah. So yeah. That's kind of I don't know if because we're so used to panic, and we're we're forgetting that we're

Me: We're only at two modes. Right?

Them: feeling like you panicking.

Me: Yeah.

Them: But I think that was good for me to remember that, you know, the bigger picture is

Me: Right.

Them: not sunny yet. In in five weeks, it might be sunny a lot sunnier, it we're not yet. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. Yeah, I know. I agree. And I don't have any sense of how to get a better picture than that. I was thinking and what's his name? One of our better contacts there, program just did, you know, accepted the data VBL reports. I was wondering if I should you know, try to call him up and, you know, just he's the one who's on his son's big one as well. To see if there's any sensitive but I I mean, I feel like it's you know, even in the old days, was a giant firewall between DGA and when that there's there weren't any tea leaves to be read

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, even in normal times. But maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

Them: I mean, if you if you have the time, you could

Me: Yeah.

Them: you know, you're good at talking to people without putting them on the spot. You've you know?

Me: Yeah. And so, I mean, that but that's the only thing I can imagine. I mean, I'm I'm not really really gotten any intel one way or another about you know, what's happening besides wheels slowly turning.

Them: Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Well, I'm tired of holding my breath, so

Me: Yeah. I know. Me too. So so, yeah, I mean, I guess that's the the answer is, you know, we're cautiously optimistic. And we're continuing to write proposals and we think I mean, I am I mean, maybe one thing to say is I am as optimistic about next year's funding round as I am about this year's funding round, which is to say not, you know, like three years ago, but not like I was three months ago.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Like, I think writing proposals is not a futile effort. I think, you know, I think that the at the very least, pros and cons of the the the competition factors balance one another out to make it you know, awash. If not, you know, better because people are throwing up their hands or what have you. And I'm willing to bet there's gonna be some funding. I mean, the be really hard for it to turn around and be what the administration said.

Them: Yeah.

Me: So

Them: Yeah.

Me: So I think that's a that's a net positive, even if a negative is a net positive in this world.

Them: Yes. Followed that.

Me: 15% down is great. Mhmm.

Them: That's right.

Me: I

Them: And no building, and you can't find your program officer. But other than that, you're it's

Me: Exactly. Yeah. Something that

Them: good. Yeah.

Me: Yeah. Mhmm.

Them: Okay. I haven't done much with the organizational budget more than, you know, it seemed for FY '26 mostly because you know, it just seems like an exercise in futility until we actually have numbers

Me: Right. I think that makes sense.

Them: But we do I think either I know either way we were assuming, like, I had Slacked about, you know, the full spending of the DESE money and

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and you know, the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: they really wanted you know, hoping that some

Me: Yes.

Them: can come from that little pocket of money.

Me: Yes. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Yeah. I'm gonna you know, I'm trying to talk to various folks on various sides about that just to orient the project work in that way too. I mean, I had a check\-in with his son the other day and, you know, just feels like she's alignable toward kinds of things that we know we wanna do. We haven't really talked talked about existing, you know, waning projects in that direction, but we should. I wanna

Them: Mhmm.

Me: see if I can talk to Scott and Leslie before Leslie disappears about sort of high level AI infrastructure dreaming just to try to get a sense of what, you know, what we should be putting on the table. It doesn't further further itself away. Mhmm.

Them: Mhmm. Yeah. Exactly. With right. Right. With some solid planning and resources.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: And yeah. The same thing is I I haven't we've you and I talked about the

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Bose learning everywhere money It's not in any it

Me: Right.

Them: you know, it's not in any of my more optimistic

Me: Mhmm.

Them: budgets. It will be in my pessimistic budget, most likely.

Me: Right. Mhmm.

Them: But the then there's another either way, for you to think about, there's another potential source.

Me: Right. That's a good point. Yeah. So, I mean, I think and I do think it's worth our know, recognizing that, you know, when you put some of those together, you you know, especially if you put it together with projects, you there's, you know, resources to do something real.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And so what do we do with that? Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. And for both Dessie and for the learning everywhere money, there's cost sharing there if we're going for any private foundation that requires

Me: That's interesting point as well. Yeah.

Them: cost sharing or something like that. So,

Me: Yeah.

Them: it's it's it's money worth its weight in money. Yeah.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Kylie well, just the whole strategic committee, like, what's happening with that and

Me: Yeah. Yeah. I mean so so that's worth spending a minute on just

Them: mhmm.

Me: you know, just whatever high level thoughts have been floating through our heads. I mean, I've been saying to various people and to myself and whatever that you know, after September, we'll be meeting differently. But I don't really know anything more than that. You know, I think that the you know, I have when Kate was asking about it, I was you know? And maybe I mailed about this to some group. But know, the I think that there is a professional development group that is kind of monitoring and moving forward with, you know, with the right guardrails, and that's not gonna not gonna change the world. But, you know, but they're they should be blessed to to go off and and, you know,

Them: Okay.

Me: monitor and experiment to some degree. And I think I don't know whether it's I don't know what the business development, the standard business development piece should be besides Lizzie and myself It should be than that. I think this, you know, user discovery stuff I'm ranting about. I did just get a name of somebody from our Pose contact out in California who knows a person in in Maine. Who looks like she's been a sort of many faceted player for twenty years and of startups in the world and and could be a Rick like person. So I'm gonna see if I get on her, radar screen and and either you know, bring her into, you know, conversation or get a name from her or what have you. So I think

Them: Mhmm.

Me: that could help us. At least think about that front. And And then the grand planning, you know, Manhattan project or whatever kind of thing could be another source of of meeting and stuff. But but I I don't know. I mean, these are just strands that are kind of waving in the air right now.

Them: Yeah.

Me: I don't know what meeting looks like and company meeting looks like. And days and timing. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. And and we do have a development person who is going right, somehow they need to

Me: Right.

Them: fit into that too.

Me: Exactly.

Them: They're gonna feel very new.

Me: Yes. Yep.

Them: And then I think we have

Me: Think that's very true.

Them: communications, which is gonna be

Me: Yes.

Them: important. That's also it feels like a piece that's

Me: Football, it's complicated at the same time. Yeah.

Them: just yeah. And you know, this is me gearing up to say, like, I I like having Kylie in the room because I think

Me: Yeah.

Them: I think that she well, she certainly protects me from doing even more work, and I have a feeling she's probably doing the same for you too or just knowing someone else is keeping track of some of these things.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: But it does it does feel like it's a more dispersed what is it? It's

Me: Right.

Them: I'm struggling to find a definition for all of these different threads. I think you're pretty much saying the same thing. It's

Me: I think I think so. Yes. And, you know, and I think people are feeling that too. I mean, I think the I think the I am you know, I'm sort of cognizant that, you know, that I think that there is value in our learning new ropes with the sort of user discovery notion. I also

Them: Mhmm.

Me: that it's not there is not a clear end game, and that might be one of the

Them: Mhmm.

Me: somebody would help us tease out. But I can I can and would like to make people busy for six months doing the activities that are involved in that?

Them: Mhmm.

Me: I don't know what our end goal in that besides getting better at hearing from people is. It might be that that's part of the point and that we're trying to figure out if there is a product or a new line of thinking or a new something that we should be doing. And that's that the so what after six months is the the end goal.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And I I don't think that amorphousness is so great that it should I think people can be busy and move toward the end goal. I'm just recognizing the tension involved in the

Them: Yeah.

Me: so why are we doing this question. And, you know, I don't have a great I don't have a good answer for that with a think the board would be totally on board with this. So I know some people want us to do this sort of thing for years and what And I think people understand the notion of it but I don't quite know what goals, ground rules, targets to set to feel like we're coming out the other end of it with something. And, yeah, I agree. Having a Danielle equivalent would be great. I don't know if that's in the cards or not at all, and it I don't think we can set out at the beginning assuming it is. So does that change our so it's an acknowledged sort of semi amorphous portion of this.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And the other ones are equally amorphous. I mean, I guess the well, maybe as I talk it through, maybe the answer is like, it is product development you know, phase zero. And It is the concrete way to try to answer this question we were swimming in the last few months of, like, is there something else we should be doing besides the things that we're doing with the federal and the something that we're like like, we don't know what that is. And if it's product light, we don't even know how to get started with it.

Them: Yeah.

Me: And getting started with it by just talking to another is not gonna

Them: Yeah.

Me: do anything. So, you know, the the goal is to see, like, is there there there in one or two strands of

Them: Mhmm.

Me: user need that might lead us to, oh, that's a thing we could develop or a thing we could work with somebody else on.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: Or a pitch we could take to, you know, to to somebody who's already got a a product going. So I think that's that's the six nine month run\-in the long term product development you know, strategy. And I guess the way I would frame that piece is that it's that our if the sort of financial scarcity concern were alleviated at least some degree so we could think I think the model is what I've been advocating is we we get good ideas that we know are grounded in needs. We get millions of dollars from SF. To build those out. And then we turn them into good ideas that are somewhere along the spectrum of free cool experiments to for sale things through somebody x and y and z. So we're sticking to our knitting but we're augmenting it with real things and turning it into more real stuff. And that that model is something that would take five or six years to build. But we're not gonna like, we could not do it and just try to be federal We we can't just pretend we have a product. And, you know, we're also doing the foundation thing on the side anyway, so we're doing everything we can. But this is a long there's a long game to be had in that, and it starts by listening to users and we need a year to learn that users exist. Know, much less listen to them. So Mhmm.

Them: Yeah. I yeah. As you were saying that, was thinking about, like, you know, we put out that pie chart

Me: Mhmm.

Them: and we put you know, I think we said 60% what do we say? 60% fed, 50% fed, then 30, 20 equivalent about thirty and twenty. But if if if maybe we were gonna very dully define what Kylie could project manage. It's like making that

Me: Mhmm.

Them: moving us towards that pie chart being a reality.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Over five years or whatever.

Me: Yeah. I think so. And, I mean, I think the, you know, the I think the thing so yes, she should be in the room. And the the corollary to that that I was, you know, didn't say but was and said, I think, is that she also she needs a target to be, you know,

Them: Yes.

Me: focused on or she'll go crazy. But I think she understands and resonates

Them: Right.

Me: with I mean, she understands and and resonates more than anybody else has so far with this

Them: Yep.

Me: sort of user discovery piece. And I think she knows that there's a means to an end there. And and what that is is really the product development sort of life cycle piece, which already fits in with a lot of what she does anywhere is adjacent the kinds of things she's learned up on anyway is something that's a skill that

Them: Yeah. Mhmm.

Me: can be learned, and there's lots to be learned about it. And is a

Them: Mhmm.

Me: it's a project with milestones. You know, it's a multi multiyear, multi month project with milestones. But essentially, like, project product discovery, user discovery is what we're about right now in that

Them: Yeah.

Me: And our goal is six or nine months from now to, like, figure out if there's

Them: Yep.

Me: any there there and what the next step might be.

Them: Yep.

Me: And can we get her and us a mentor in doing that?

Them: Yeah. Yeah.

Me: Essentially, bringing a coach in? To be, you know, Rick working with Kylie, with Leslie, knowing enough on the side about us in that world to help us not

Them: Mhmm.

Me: go completely astray. And we being involved enough to know, provide the big vision. But not getting stuck in the detail knowing I don't have to get stuck in the details. Mhmm.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Yeah.

Them: Yeah. That makes sense to me. That's helpful.

Me: Yeah. No. That's helpful for me as well. Because I think that's the think that's the only way. So I think we can't not you know, think about product I think we can't do it tomorrow, and nobody in the board would say I mean, if I said, we think we found a product tomorrow, they would all laugh us out of the room because they know we don't have any

Them: Mhmm.

Me: But I think it is possible to say, we have an engine that could like, if turned in the right way, could create product and still be a research, you know, or it could create research driven products and also be r and d at the

Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.

Me: time. You know, it's the goal of, like, some like, every now and then, every four or five, six you know, something gets over think it's over the fence there. And in the meantime, we're happy to be doing r and d as well because

Them: Yep.

Me: that's the way things happen. Mhmm. Yeah.

Them: I think that's great. I think that's great. Now we just have to afford Kylie on overhead to do it.

Me: Exactly. That's a whole other question.

Them: Mean, a portion of it, but but I think we can't, you know, in the next that's

Me: Right.

Them: why we've got some money. I think we can

Me: Right. Yeah. And I think that's you know, I think there's a little bit of I mean, so some of the open question is, like, the ideal situation is this vague amorphous tries retiree Manhattan Project something is not divorced from

Them: Mhmm.

Me: the other stuff we're talking about. Like, hopefully, it's a little bit behind what

Them: Right.

Me: learning, and we're kinda like, oh, well, AI ish toward that problem would be good, and then we define the problem better. And we're like,

Them: Mhmm.

Me: That's actually a strand of something that we're doing. And if Kylie is involved in this piece, that makes that, you know, all the easier because then she could be like, oh, okay. That's, you know, that's the development we're doing along the lines of this something.

Them: Yeah.

Me: I think there's a lot of unification that could come there. And if we're doing if we tilt things in the right direction, and I think we do by nature when we're saying like, simulations that you could customize. Mean, that's that's when we're saying like, okay, That's the first year of, you know, that's half of the first year of his son's project. And it's that what Youthquake is doing, it's something like we're gonna take all that

Them: Yeah.

Me: and split it in two different directions and we're gonna figure out what those two directions are in the next few months.

Them: Mhmm.

Me: And we're gonna start to move along those. Right? And

Them: Mhmm.

Me: and if we do that, then the work that comes out of the NSF projects is work that's aligned in that way, but is follow on project because we can point to the project in the first place.

Them: Yeah.

Me: You know, so I think I think there's a potential for real alignment there.

Them: Yeah.

Me: Mhmm. Okay. Good. Well, this helps me

Them: Great. Okay. Good. I hope Granola got all that.

Me: answer the question of whether I was gonna make any I'm I'm if I make two board slides. You know, that that that that can be one of them. I was I'm not gonna make a slide deck, but I I need an answer for some of this stuff, that was helpful.

Them: Okay. Yeah. That's good. All right.

Me: Okay. Internet speed. I need to answer a question, but I don't remember the details of the question.

Them: If you don't remember, then you can know. Be sure that I don't remember.

Me: Well, I know that Judy was Judy was lacking

Them: Mean, I remember the Excel sheet.

Me: Judy started to slack you about it, and I was like, actually, I'll Slack Sue because

Them: Yeah.

Me: it's on my to do list, and we're all gonna Slack one another in the circular, you know,

Them: Yeah. No. No. No. So, Lorelei, had sent me a a Excel, you know, a little quick chart. So I'll I'll dig that out of my email somewhere and send it to you so that you can take a look

Me: Okay. Sure.

Them: I mean, I can I can visualize an Excel chart, but I can't visualize the numbers that were on there, there wasn't

Me: That's fine. Yep. I mean, I think my

Them: or anything? Yeah.

Me: I think my gut level takeaway is you know, we we want good Internet speed. I don't think we want to, you know, call Windstream and ask them if they can dig up parking lot yet again for us because we need you know, the best fiber in the world for the servers we don't have. So probably, you know, if Comcast gives us a, you know, a cable modem from 1995, I don't think we want it. But probably we can get things that are good. But I you know? So send it send it on. I'm happy to answer on

Them: Okay. Yeah. I'll send it on.

Me: time frame we need, which is probably yesterday. Mhmm.

Them: Yep. Well, we'll see. Last thing for me, I think, is I don't know if I conveyed to you that I was gonna meet with Rebecca Ellis before I left for a vacation. You left for a vacation about how she had, she had two requests from me. One oops.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Not important for this conversation, but the second one was her raise. Where that was, you know, sitting. And, it did explain to her that we weren't giving raises. You know, it was unfortunate this whole set of circumstances, and I'm really sorry about that. And she also talked about how she was young, and now she's learned something for when she's older. She was she was you know, she was good about it. She was sanguine. But I I did say that when the finances are less tight you know, we we prioritize

Me: We've not we've not forgotten about this. Yeah. We've not forgotten about this. Right?

Them: Yeah. We so we're prioritizing how to, like, roll things And so she you know, now that she's brought it to our attention, Jay's brought

Me: Okay.

Them: it to our attention, it's gonna be one of the first things that we address that doesn't mean I'm promising a raise.

Me: Yep.

Them: It just means it's one of the first things I address. So I just wanna make you and Judy aware of that that

Me: That's that's great. I think that's I think that's the right response, you know, without

Them: yeah.

Me: necessarily going into the details of of how we anchored, you know, crazily from Jay. And I don't even know if Rebecca knows the number Jay sent over, but that's a whole other conversation with Jay to

Them: Yeah.

Me: you know, get her to not anchor us into the world of oblivion. But

Them: Yeah. I didn't I didn't wanna have a conversation with either about, like, where did this

Me: Yep. No. Right. Yeah.

Them: come from? How do you ask?

Me: That's great. I think that's exactly right, and it's good to know that she, you know, took it there. And

Them: Okay.

Me: that's what I'd expect from her about, you know, she should expect from us that we're being human about it too. So

Them: Yeah. She's she's like, I kept waiting for a raise, and then I asked one of my friends what happened, you know, that they haven't said anything. And their friend was like, you idiot. You're supposed to tell a company you want a raise. You can't just sit back and wait for them to be nice to you. And she's like,

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: oh. I'm like, well, I I wish the bar was a little higher for us, but the reality is your friend

Me: Uh\-huh.

Them: right. Like and then he

Me: Yeah. Yeah.

Them: there's just a million things competing for it.

Me: Mhmm.

Them: Attention. You know? Have to advocate for yourself and yeah.

Me: Yep. That's well, that's good. I'm glad we're we're learning lessons in one way. We'll make

Them: So

Me: make lemon lemonade out of it in some way.

Them: Right. That's right. Alright.

Me: Okay. Very good. Let me know if more comes up, and I will see you tomorrow.

Them: Sounds good.

Me: Alright.

Them: Alright. Take care.

Me: Bye.

Them: Bye.
